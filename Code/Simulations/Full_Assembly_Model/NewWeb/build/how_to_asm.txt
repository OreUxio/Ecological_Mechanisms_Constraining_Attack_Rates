How to generate assembler code for core of NewWeb dynamics.

(1) Put the piece of code into a C source file, and compile with
optimization options, twice, with and without -S added.  This will
output a .o object-code file and a .s assembler file.

(2) convert the object file into INTEL assembler code using the
command
	objdump --no-show-raw-insn -d -M intel <filename>.o

(3) convert hexadecimal line numbers into decimal labels for jump/branch
target points, remove the hexadecimal line numbers

(4) look at the .s file and add all the assembler instructions that
look useful.  (See current version of packed_simulation_asm.s)  Add
the line
     .intel_syntax noprefix 
on the top.

(5) also replace jmp,nop,nop,nop,... sequences with aligned
directives from .s file.

(6) put a declaration of the C function you started with into a
corresponding header file, e.g. packed_simulation_asm.h

That's it, essentially.
