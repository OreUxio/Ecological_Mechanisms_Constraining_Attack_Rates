  abstract = {The case of fisheries management illustrates how the inherent structural instability of ecosystems can have deep-running policy implications. We contrast eleven types of management plans to achieve maximum sustainable yields (MSY) from multiple stocks and compare their effectiveness based on the results of management strategy evaluations (MSE) that use complex food webs in their operating models. Plans that primarily target specific stock sizes (B\_MSY) consistently led to higher yields than plans targeting specific fishing pressures (F\_MSY). A new type of self-optimising control rule, introduced here to conquer uncertainty due to structural instability, led to intermediate yields. Plans to "maximise the yield from each stock separately" in the sense of a Nash equilibrium produced total yields comparable to yields from plans to maximise total harvested biomass, but tended to be more robust to structural instability. Most types of plans outperformed single-species management plans that set pressure targets without explicitly considering ecological interactions. Our analyses highlight trade-offs between yields, amiability to fair negotiations, and continuity with current approaches in the European context. Based on these results, we recommend directions for future developments of EU fisheries policy.},

  shorttitle = {Internal {{Nutrient Fluxes Counteract Decreases}} in {{External Load}}},
  abstract = {Abstract Despite a decrease of about 30\% in the external nutrient inputs, no corresponding improvement has been observed in the state of the open Gulf of Finland. At the end of the 1990s the external nutrient load to the Gulf totalled 120 000 tonnes (t) yr-1 of nitrogen (N) and 7000 t yr-1 of phosphorus (P). Relative to its surface area, the nutrient load of the Gulf is 2 to 3 times the average of the Baltic Sea. Despite the decrease in loading, an increase in the phosphate-P concentration was observed both in the surface and near-bottom layers around the mid-1990s. The reason for this development was most probably the acceleration of internal loading, triggered by poor oxygen conditions at the sediment\textendash{}water interface of the eastern Gulf, where the oxygen conditions weakened during the 1990s, after being relatively good in the 1980s and the early 1990s. On the basis of experimental data from the coastal Gulf of Finland, the phosphate-P flux from the reduced surface sediment to water averaged 13 kg km-2 d-1. This corresponds to total amounts which can explain the observed trends of P in the open Gulf. The low N:P ratio of the sediment efflux can partly explain the N limitation of primary production in the Gulf.},

  abstract = {Classic local stability theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist despite empiricists' abundant documentation of such complexity in nature. This contradiction has puzzled biologists for decades. While some have explored how stability may be achieved in small modules of a few interacting species, rigorous demonstrations of how large complex and ecologically realistic networks dynamically persist remain scarce and inadequately understood. Here, we help fill this void by combining structural models of complex food webs with nonlinear bioenergetic models of population dynamics parameterized by biological rates that are allometrically scaled to populations' average body masses. Increasing predator-prey body mass ratios increase population persistence up to a saturation level that is reached by invertebrate and ectotherm vertebrate predators when being 10 or 100 times larger than their prey respectively. These values are corroborated by empirical predator-prey body mass ratios from a global data base. Moreover, negative effects of diversity (i.e. species richness) on stability (i.e. population persistence) become neutral or positive relationships at these empirical ratios. These results demonstrate that the predator-prey body mass ratios found in nature may be key to enabling persistence of populations in complex food webs and stabilizing the diversity of natural ecosystems.},

  abstract = {In the context of present global changes, interest in understanding how systems respond to anthropogenic environmental pressures and stress has increased. Indices that characterize ecosystem state are helpful tools for the interpretation of ecosystem responses. The central question is how to link these responses to ecosystem structure and functioning and to quantify ecosystem persistence, resistance or resilience. Quantification and characterization of trophic networks by ecological network analysis (ENA) indices is proceeding rapidly, especially in the field of coastal ecology. In this contribution, we review several theories that relate ecosystem structure and function to stability. The structure and functioning of ecosystems change during the maturation of ecosystems. In the first section, the maturation of ecosystems is described using thermodynamics. In the second and third parts of this paper, we define some concepts for analysing structure and functioning of food webs and discuss their relation to stability. In the last section, we describe three ENA indices and their link to stability. We demonstrate that ENA provides powerful tools for describing local stability, combining quantitative and qualitative concepts. However, it remains incomplete for describing real conservation cases that combine local and global stability.},

  abstract = {Any given species of snake tends to eat one or a very few basic prey types, and sympatric snake species tend to concentrate on different prey species. When correlations between numbers of sympatric prey species and snake species densities in various feeding guilds are examined by the method of path coefficients, distinct patterns emerge. Much of the variance in numbers of sympatric snake species is related to prey species densities. This effect is not due to common correlation with latitude. Correlations between the number of sympatric snake species in particular feeding guilds and the number of sympatric species of nonprey are, in nearly all cases, due to common correlation with latitude. These observations support the view that where there are more species of prey, more species of predators can coexist because there are more ways to avoid competition for food. This relationship is very nearly all that is required to explain observed latitudinal gradients in number of sympatric species of snakes in some feeding guilds.},

New transformations are introduced which enable one to prove some theoretical and computational properties. In particular we show that the structure preserving doubling algorithm (SDA) of Anderson (Int J Control 28(2): 295-306, 1978) is in fact the cyclic reduction algorithm of Hockney (J Assoc Comput Mach 12:95-113, 1965) and Buzbee et al. (SIAM J Numer Anal 7:627-656, 1970), applied to a suitable UQME. A new algorithm obtained by complementing our transformations with the shrink-and-shift technique of Ramaswami is presented. The new algorithm is accurate and much faster than SDA when applied to some examples concerning fluid queue models.},

Major advances have been made in describing the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem processes, in identifying functionally important species, and in revealing underlying mechanisms. There is, however, uncertainty as to how results obtained in recent experiments scale up to landscape and regional levels and generalize across ecosystem types and processes. Larger numbers of species are probably needed to reduce temporal variability in ecosystem processes in changing environments. A major future challenge is to determine how biodiversity dynamics, ecosystem processes, and abiotic factors interact.}

  abstract = {We develop a framework for the objective selection of a suite of indicators for use in fisheries management. The framework encompasses eight steps, and provides guidance on pitfalls to be avoided at each step. Step 1 identifies user groups and their needs, featuring the setting of operational objectives, and Step 2 identifies a corresponding list of candidate indicators. Step 3 assigns weights to nine screening criteria for the candidate indicators: concreteness, theoretical basis, public awareness, cost, measurement, historic data, sensitivity, responsiveness, and specificity. Step 4 scores the indicators against the criteria, and Step 5 summarizes the results. Steps 3\textendash{}5 offer technical aspects on which guidance is provided, including scoring standards for criteria and a generalized method for applying the standards when scoring individual indicators. Multi-criterion summarization methods are recommended for most applications. Steps 6 and 7 are concerned with deciding how many indicators are needed, and making the final selection of complementary suites of indicators. Ordinarily, these steps are done interactively with the users of the indicators, thus providing guidance on process rather than technical approach. Step 8 is the clear presentation to all users of the information contained. The discussion also includes the special case in which indicators are used in formal decision rules.},

  abstract = {Secchi depth, as a proxy of water transparency, provides valuable information on the availability of light to the underwater ecosystems. Changes in water transparency have also been widely linked to eutrophication and phytoplankton biomass. This study aimed to describe the development of water transparency in the Baltic Sea through a unique century-long set of Secchi depth observations. Furthermore, the aim was to explain the role of phytoplankton in determining water transparency in these optically complex waters. Water transparency in the open Baltic Sea has decreased during the last one hundred years. The development differs between the sub-basins of the Baltic Sea. The decrease has been most profound in the north-eastern Baltic sub-basins, but apparent also in parts of the Southern and Central Baltic. In many of the northern areas the decrease has accelerated during the last decades, whereas in the Southern Baltic a recent increase was observed. The analysis of simultaneous chlorophyll a observations during the period from 1972 to 2006 revealed that during summer time, 13\textendash{}17\% of the light attenuation can be attributed to phytoplankton. In spring, the average proportion is between 31 and 42\%, with great variation between observations. We find Secchi depth a suitable indicator of eutrophication, integrating various organic matter related features. It should always be applied with sufficient background information of the optical properties of the water mass, and complemented by other indicators.},

  abstract = {Understanding of complex trophic interactions in ecosystems requires correct descriptions of the rate at which predators consume a variety of different prey species. Field and laboratory data on multispecies communities are rarely sufficient and usually cannot provide an unambiguous test for the theory. As a result, the conventional way of constructing a multi-prey functional response is speculative, and often based on assumptions that are difficult to verify. Predator responses allowing for prey selectivity and active switching are thought to be more biologically relevant compared to the standard proportion-based consumption. However, here we argue that the functional responses with switching may not be applicable to communities with a broad spectrum of resource types. We formulate a set of general rules that a biologically sound parameterization of a predator functional response should satisfy, and show that all existing formulations for the multispecies response with prey selectivity and switching fail to do so. Finally, we propose a universal framework for parameterization of a multi-prey functional response by combining patterns of food selectivity and proportion-based feeding.},

  abstract = {Many estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems have increasingly experienced degradation caused by multiple stressors. Anthropogenic pressures alter natural ecosystems and the ecosystems are not considered to have recovered unless secondary succession has returned the ecosystem to the pre-existing condition or state. However, depending upon the scales of time, space and intensity of anthropogenic disturbance, return along the historic trajectory of the ecosystem may: (1) follow natural restoration though secondary succession; (2) be re-directed through ecological restoration, or (3) be unattainable. In order to address the gaps in knowledge about restoration and recovery of estuarine and coastal ecosystems, this special feature includes the present overview and other contributions to provide a synthesis of our knowledge about recovery patterns, rates and restoration effectiveness. From the 51 examples collated in this contribution, we refine the recovery from the list of stressors into six recovery mechanisms: (1) recovery from sediment modification, which includes all aspects of dredging and disposal; (2) recovery by complete removal of stressors limiting natural ecosystem processes, which includes tidal marsh and inundation restoration; (3) recovery by speed of organic degradation, which includes oil discharge, fish farm wastes, sewage disposal, and paper mill waste; (4) recovery from persistent pollutants, which includes chemical discharges, such as TBT; (5) recovery from excessive biological removal, related to fisheries and (6) recovery from hydrological and morphological modification. Drawing upon experience both from these many examples and from an example of one comprehensive study, we show that although in some cases recovery can take {$<$}5 years, especially for the short-lived and high-turnover biological components, full recovery of coastal marine and estuarine ecosystems from over a century of degradation can take a minimum of 15\textendash{}25 years for attainment of the original biotic composition and diversity may lag far beyond that period.},

These two properties generally lead to the surprising conclusion that the aggregate preference of a population of predators does change with prey relative density. This phenomenon may result in negative or positive switching, depending on the circumstances, with negative switching being the more likely result. Such population negative switching is found in previously published experimental data. Implications are given for the analysis of ecological data, and some implications for the stability of field populations are suggested.},

  abstract = {We investigate the influence of functional responses (Lotka-Volterra or Holling type), initial topological web structure (randomly connected or niche model), adaptive behavior (adaptive foraging and predator avoidance) and the type of constraints on the adaptive behavior (linear or nonlinear) on the stability and structure of food webs. Two kinds of stability are considered: one is the network robustness (i.e., the proportion of species surviving after population dynamics) and the other is the species deletion stability. When evaluating the network structure, we consider link density as well as the trophic level structure. We show that the types of functional responses and initial web structure do not have a large effect on the stability of food webs, but foraging behavior has a large stabilizing effect. It leads to a positive complexity-stability relationship whenever higher ``complexity'' implies more potential prey per species. The other type of adaptive behavior, predator avoidance behavior, makes food webs only slightly more stable. The observed link density after population dynamics depends strongly on the presence or absence of adaptive foraging, and on the type of constraints used. We also show that the trophic level structure is preserved under population dynamics with adaptive foraging. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Species diversity was found to correlate positively with lake surface area, with best descriptive equations being power curve functions. z-values of 0.23, 0.17 and 0.24 were found respectively for mollusc, zooplankton, and fish species-area equations. Species turnover rates over a half-century interval were calculated to be 0.50\%/year for molluscs in a large lake, and 0.28\%/year for the zooplankton communities of twelve lakes. Zooplankton turnover rates were negatively correlated with lake surface area and initial species number.},

  abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive aims to improve ecological status within river basins. This requires knowledge of responses of aquatic assemblages to recovery processes that occur after measures have been taken to reduce major stressors. A systematic literature review comparatively assesses recovery measures across the four major water categories. The main drivers of degradation stem primarily from human population growth and increases in land use and water use changes. These drivers and pressures are the same in all four water categories: rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters. Few studies provide evidence of how ecological knowledge might enhance restoration success. Other major bottlenecks are the lack of data, effects mostly occur only in short-term and at local scale, the organism group(s) selected to assess recovery does not always provide the most appropriate response, the time lags of recovery are highly variable, and most restoration projects incorporate restoration of abiotic conditions and do not include abiotic extremes and biological processes. Restoration ecology is just emerging as a field in aquatic ecology and is a site, time and organism group-specific activity. It is therefore difficult to generalise. Despite the many studies only few provide evidence of how ecological knowledge might enhance restoration success.},

Phase II stresses communication: statements about risk situations are best regarded as acts of persuasive communication, that is, as messages intended to persuade a listener of the correctness of a point of view.

The interaction of defects generated by an inherent instability creates noise and an effective viscosity. By its statistical large scale properties the model is shown to belong to the universality class of the noisy Burgers-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. The single particle trajectories display superdiffusive behavior.}

  abstract = {Populations of goldenrods (Solidago canadensis) were sampled to determine the effects of three stem gall insects, Gnorimoshema gallaesolidaginis (Gelechiidae), Eurosta solidaginis (Tephritidae), and Rhopalomyia solidaginis (Cecidomyiidae) on resource allocation patterns in the plants. Gall infestations were as high as 38.5\% and the dominant gall insect differed from site to site. The gall insects caused significant and highly specific effects on the plants. Each of the three gall types increased stem production, decreased current rhizome production, and lowered seed reproductive allocation as measured both by inflorescence production and propagule production. Vegetative reproductive allocation (the proportion of biomass allocated to new rhizome) was unaffected. With the exception of ball gall-beaing ramets, the number of new rhizomes produced was unaffected by the presence of galls. Growth of the elliptical gall significantly reduced shoot height and significantly increased lateral branching and propagule weight. Formation of the ball significantly reduced propagule weight and the number of new rhizomes produced. Thus gall insect-plant interactions may play an important role in the evolution of plant life history patterns in certain taxa. Future studies are needed to determine the effects of galls on entire clones (genets) and the implications of gall infestation on future growth, survivorship, and reproduction.},

  abstract = {Abstract Grave environmental problems, including contamination of biota by organochlorines and heavy metals, and increasing deep-water oxygen deficiency, were discovered in the Baltic Sea in the late 1960s. Toxic pollutants, including the newly discovered PCB, were initially seen as the main threat to the Baltic ecosystem, and the impaired reproduction found in Baltic seals and white-tailed eagles implied a threat also to human fish eaters. Countermeasures gradually gave results, and today the struggle to limit toxic pollution of the Baltic is an international environmental success story. Calculations showed that Baltic deep-water oxygen consumption must have increased, and that the Baltic nutrient load had grown about fourfold for nitrogen and 8 times for phosphorus. Evidence of increased organic production at all trophic levels in the ecosystem gradually accumulated. Phosphorus was first thought to limit Baltic primary production, but measurements soon showed that nitrogen is generally limiting in the open Baltic proper, except for nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Today, the debate is concerned with whether phosphorus, by limiting nitrogen-fixers, can control open-sea ecosystem production, even where phytoplankton is clearly nitrogen limited. The Baltic lesson teaches us that our views of newly discovered environmental problems undergo repeated changes, and that it may take decades for scientists to agree on their causes. Once society decides on countermeasures, it may take decades for them to become effective, and for nature to recover. Thus, environmental management decisions can hardly wait for scientific certainty. We should therefore view environmental management decisions as experiments, to be monitored, learned from, and then modified as needed.},

  abstract = {Through implementing environmental Directives, Europe has moved towards coordinated and integrated catchment-to-coast management, following the most novel legislation on ecosystem-based approaches worldwide. The novel joint synthesis of this direction reviewed here allows us to regard the Water Framework Directive (WFD) as a `deconstructing structural approach' whereas the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is a `holistic functional approach', i.e. the WFD has split the ecosystem into several biological quality elements, then it compares the structure of these (such as species complement) individually before combining them and attempting to determine the overall condition. In contrast the MSFD concentrates on the set of 11 descriptors which together summarize the way in which the whole system functions. We emphasize that both Directives are frameworks on which many other directives are linked but that they need to be fully and seamlessly integrated to give a land to open sea system of assessment and management. Hence, by taking account of the experience gained in the WFD implementation, together with that from regional sea conventions, such as OSPAR (North East Atlantic) or HELCOM (Baltic Sea), we propose in this contribution an integrative approach for the environmental status assessment, within the MSFD.},

All tests were performed in a flow calibration facility ranging over Reynolds number from 25 to 110 000. The experiments with the four installation effects were compared with a reference experiment. The error and the change in standard deviation compared to the reference experiment were calculated. The standard deviation serve as a measure of the noise level of the flow meter. The results show that all disturbances generated errors in the flow measurement. The maximum errors were mainly in the range of 2-4\% of flow rate, but at very low flow rates the pulsating flow caused larger errors. In most of the flow range there were no or smaller errors. All installation effects also generated an increase in the noise level. The different pipe configurations increased the standard deviation up to more than 100\%. The pulsating flow induced even higher enlargements in the noise level. The errors and the increase in the standard deviation are present in about the same flow ranges. The results demonstrate not only that the installation effects tested introduce errors in the flow measurements but also that these effects can be detected from the noise level in the data. The noise level was determined from the standard deviation}

The first hypothesis proposes that gall-forming insectspecies richness increases as more potential host\textendash{}plant species areavailable. The second hypothesis implies that soil fertility affects plantcolonization by gall-forming insects. Seven sites, representing strongdifferences in vegetation and soil were chosen at the Lacandona tropical rainforest region, Chiapas, Mexico. Overall, we found 1522 individual plantsbelonging to 340 different plant species. From this, we found gall-forminginsects on 737 (43.9\%) plants and on 74 (22\%) of total plant species. We found asignificant negative correlation between gall-forming insect species richnessand species richness of plants, which does not support the hypothesis that plantspecies richness is an important factor in generating the radiation ofgall-forming insects. Using phosphorus as an indicator of soil fertility, wefound the lowest number of plants with gall-forming insects and the smallestgall-forming insect load per individual plant in the more fertile soil(alluvial). In contrast, the highest number of plants with galls and the highestgall-forming insect load per plant were found at a savanna-like vegetationsite, where the poorest soil was recorded. These results did not support thesoil fertility hypothesis in terms of species richness, but did with respect toabundance of plants with galls.},

  title = {A Stochastic Biodiversity Model with Overlapping Niche Structure},
  volume = {8},
  issn = {1874-1738, 1874-1746},
  abstract = {The niche is a fundamental ecological concept that underpins many explanations of patterns of biodiversity. The complexity of niche processes in ecological systems, however, means that it is difficult to capture them accurately in theoretical models of community assembly. In this study, we build upon simple neutral biodiversity models by adding the important ingredient of overlapping niche structure. Our model is spatially implicit and contains a fixed number of equal-sized habitats. Each species in the metacommunity arises through a speciation event; at which time, it is randomly assigned a fundamental niche or set of environments/habitats in which it can persist. Within each habitat, species compete with other species that have different but overlapping fundamental niches. Species abundances then change through ecological drift; each, however, is constrained by its maximum niche breadth and by the presence of other species in its habitats. Using our model, we derive analytical expressions for steady-state species abundance distributions, steady-state distributions of niche breadth across individuals and across species, and dynamic distributions of niche breadth across species. With this framework, we identify the conditions that produce the log-series species abundance distribution familiar from neutral models. We then identify how overlapping niche structure can lead to other species abundance distributions and, in particular, ask whether these new distributions differ significantly from species abundance distributions predicted by non-overlapping niche models. Finally, we extend our analysis to consider additional distributions associated with realized niche breadths. Overall, our results show that models with overlapping niches can exhibit behavior similar to neutral models, with the caveat that species with narrow fundamental niche breadths will be very rare. If narrow-niche species are common, it must be because they are in a non-overlapping niche or have countervailing advantages over broad-niche species. This result highlights the role that niches can play in establishing demographic neutrality.},

Specifically, the framework details how to implement and link a variety of fishery, biological, and economic software packages so that alternative management strategies and procedures can be evaluated for their robustness to uncertainty before implementation. The design of the framework, including the adoption of object-orientated programming, its feasibility to be extended to new processes, and its application to new management approaches (e.g. ecosystem affects of fishing), is discussed.

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding the forces shaping ecological communities is of crucial importance for basic science and conservation. After 50 years in which ecological theory has focused on either stable communities driven by niche-based forces or nonstable ``neutral'' communities driven by demographic stochasticity, contemporary theories suggest that ecological communities are driven by the simultaneous effects of both types of mechanisms. Here we examine this paradigm using the longest available records for the dynamics of tropical trees and breeding birds. Applying a macroecological approach and fluctuation analysis techniques borrowed from statistical physics, we show that both stabilizing mechanisms and demographic stochasticity fail to play a dominant role in shaping assemblages over time. Rather, community dynamics in these two very different systems is predominantly driven by environmental stochasticity. Clearly, the current melding of niche and neutral theories cannot account for such dynamics. Our results highlight the need for a new theory of community dynamics integrating environmental stochasticity with weak stabilizing forces and suggest that such theory may better describe the dynamics of ecological communities than current neutral theories, deterministic niche-based theories, or recent hybrids.},

  abstract = {(1) The ratio: number of predator species/number of prey species is reviewed using comprehensive faunal lists for a range of freshwater habitats in Britain and North America. Prey species are defined as detritivores, herbivores and fungivores; predators eat metazoan animals as the main component of their diet. Our data refer only to invertebrates. (2) The numbers of predators and prey species are apparently very closely correlated in freshwater communities (r=0.84, In transformed data), with an average ratio of predators to prey of 0.36. The average ratio of predators to prey changes from 0.48 in small (species-poor) collections to 0.29 in large (species-rich) collections. (3) We suggest that an approximately constant ratio of predators to prey may be generated by: (a) the number of predator species being a function of the number of broad classes or kinds of prey; and (b) the number of prey species being constrained by competition between prey for `enemy free space', i.e. species that are too similar are unable to coexist with shared predators.},

  abstract = {Following widespread deterioration of coastal ecosystems since the 1960s, current environmental policies demand ecosystem recovery and restoration. However, vague definitions of recovery and untested recovery paradigms complicate efficient stewardship of coastal ecosystems. We critically examine definitions of recovery and identify and test the implicit paradigms against well-documented cases studies based on a literature review. The study highlights a need for more careful specification of recovery targets and metrics for assessing recovery in individual ecosystems. Six recovery paradigms were identified and examination of them established that partial (as opposed to full) recovery prevails, that degradation and recovery typically follow different pathways as buffers act to maintain the degraded state, and that recovery trajectories depend on the nature of the pressure as well as the connectivity of ecosystems and can differ between ecosystem components and among ecosystems. A conceptual model illustrates the findings and also indicates how restoration efforts may accelerate the recovery process.},

 method with asymptotic order optimal error estimates is proposed. This\00t

Estimates of exponential relaxation times, tr, for avifaunas of New Guinea satellite islands are calculated from analysis of four ``experiments of nature'': recolonization of exploded volcanoes, contraction in island area due to rising sea level, severing of land bridges, and disappearance of landbridge relict species. tr is in the range 3,000-18,000 years for avifaunas of islands of 50-3000 square miles (130-7800 km2), and increases with island area. Immigration coefficients decrease and extinction coefficients increase with increasing S. The results may be relevant to the design of rainforest preserves.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem rather than species management has become an explicit part of policies that
feature in international treaties and national legislation. Many of the tools that will be needed to fulfil
the requirements of these policies are still in an early stage of development. One such tool is trophic
ecosystem modelling. These models have been put forward to aid system-level understanding and
provide insight into the potential impacts of human activities. Despite this, there are many gaps in
knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, little is known about the effect of the
level of detail in a model on its performance. There has been some consideration of the effects of
model formulation, as well as the effects of the physical, biological and chemical scope of multispecies
and ecosystem models on their performance. A review of existing research indicates that
there is a humped relationship between model detail and performance for these models, and that
there are some guiding principles to consider during model development. This review gives some
insight into which model structures and assumptions are likely to aid understanding and management,
and which may be unnecessary. Further, it provides some understanding of whether some
models can capture properties of real systems that other models cannot. The main recommendation
is that the use of a single 'ultimate' ecosystem model is ill-advised, while the comparative and confirmatory
use of multiple 'minimum-realistic' models is strongly recommended.},

Here, we reexamine the major evidence for one of the chief hypotheses: dynamical constraints. Reportedly, food chain stability decreases as chain length increases. However, the separate roles of self-damping (where a species shows density dependence independent of the densities of other species in the food chain model) and chain length have not been adequately determined. We examined food webs of varying chain length while controlling for self-damping. In contrast to the prevailing hypothesis, we find a weak but significant increase in stability in longer chains when we hold constant the number of species and the number of self-damping terms. Thus, the conclusion that longer food chains are more dynamically fragile, thereby setting an upper limit to food chain length, has at best very limited theoretical support. Our results indicate that community stability should tend to lengthen, not shorten, food chains. Mechanisms limiting the length of food chains remain to be convincingly demonstrated}

  abstract = {Food webs in nature have multiple, reticulate connections between a diversity of consumers and resources. Such complexity affects web dynamics: it first spreads the direct effects of consumption and productivity throughout the web rather than focusing them at particular "trophic levels." Second, consumer densities are often donor controlled with food from across the trophic spectrum, the herbivore and detrital channels, other habitats, life-history omnivory, and even trophic mutualism. Although consumers usually do not affect these resources, increased numbers often allow consumers to depress other resources to levels lower than if donor-controlled resources were absent. We propose that such donor-controlled and "multichannel" omnivory is a general feature of consumer control and central to food web dynamics. This observation is contrary to the normal practice of inferring dynamics by simplifying webs into a few linear "trophic levels," as per "green world" theories. Such theories do not accommodate common and dynamically important features of real webs such as the ubiquity of donor control and the importance and dynamics of detritus, omnivory, resources crossing habitats, life history, nutrients (as opposed to energy), pathogens, resource defenses, and trophic symbioses. We conclude that trophic cascades and top-down community regulation as envisioned by trophic-level theories are relatively uncommon in nature.},

  volume = {20},
  abstract = {The relationship between persistent, small to moderate levels of random environmental fluctuations and limits to the similarity of competing species is studied. The analytical theory hinges on deriving conditions under which a rare invading species will tend to increase when faced with an array of resident competitors in a fluctuating environment. A general approximation scheme predicts that the effects of low levels of stochasticity will typically be small. The technique is applied explicitly to a class of symmetric, discrete-time stochastic analogs of the Lotka-Volterra equations that incorporate cross-correlation but no autocorrelation. The randomenvironment limits to similarity are always very close to the corresponding constant environment limits. However, stochasticity can either facilitate or hinder invasion. The exact limits to similarity are extremely model-dependent. In addition to the symmetric models, an analytically tractable class of models is presented that incorporates both auto- and cross-correlation and no symmetry assumptions. For all of the models investigated, the analytical theory predicts that small-scale stochasticity does little, if anything, to limit similarity. Extensive Monte Carlo results are presented that confirm the analytical results whenever the dynamics of the discretetime models are biologically reasonable in the sense that trajectories do not exhibit unrealistic crashes. Interestingly, the class of stochastic models that is well behaved in this sense includes models whose deterministic analogs are chaotic. The qualitative conclusion, supported by both the analytical and simulation results, is that for competitive guilds adequately modeled by Lotka-Volterra equations including small to moderate levels of random fluctuations, practical limits to similarity can be obtained by ignoring the stochastic terms and performing a deterministic analysis. The mathematical and biological robustness of this conclusion is discussed.},

This phenomenon can be observed by a light diffraction experiment. The Williams domains are regarded as a phase grating for the extraordinary light and the diffraction pattern of a laser beam is a spot train. When the Williams domains oscillate, the spot train oscillates like a wiper of an automobile. The frequency of this oscillatory motion can be determined by measuring the time-correlation function of the intensity of light diffracted in a suitable direction. The measurement is carried out at room temperature at which the nematic liquid crystal (MBBA) is in the nematic mesophase. (5 References).}

Initial analyses show that only 16\% of marine ecoregions have no reported marine invasions, and even that figure may be inflated due to under-reporting. International shipping, followed by aquaculture, represent the major means of introduction. Our geographically referenced and publicly available database provides a framework that can be used to highlight the invasive taxa that are most threatening, as well as to prioritize the invasion pathways that pose the greatest threat.},

  shorttitle = {Sea Sick?},
  abstract = {The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability. It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water quality in the USA. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated ecosystem assessments.},

  abstract = {Since the middle of the last century the Baltic Sea ecosystem has undergone a strong change. An obvious indicator is the increase of winter nutrient concentrations. This increase is attributed to increased anthropogenic nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea.

With a 3D ecosystem model we made a hindcast simulation of eutrophication from 1960 to 2000. The model system was able to reproduce the main hydrographic and ecologic features of this period. However, the observed strong increase in winter nutrient concentrations was underestimated by the model.

The simulated nitrogen fixation shows a pronounced interdecadal variability. Nitrogen fixation increased in the early 1990 at the same time nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea were decreasing. The changes in nutrient loads cannot fully explain the increased nitrogen fixation; in fact, the primary trigger for this increase is an intensified wind speed in winter, which is correlated with changes in the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO).},

  abstract = {We present a generic scoring system that compares the impact of alien species among members of large taxonomic groups. This scoring can be used to identify the most harmful alien species so that conservation measures to ameliorate their negative effects can be prioritized. For all alien mammals in Europe, we assessed impact reports as completely as possible. Impact was classified as either environmental or economic. We subdivided each of these categories into five subcategories (environmental: impact through competition, predation, hybridization, transmission of disease, and herbivory; economic: impact on agriculture, livestock, forestry, human health, and infrastructure). We assigned all impact reports to one of these 10 categories. All categories had impact scores that ranged from zero (minimal) to five (maximal possible impact at a location). We summed all impact scores for a species to calculate "potential impact" scores. We obtained "actual impact" scores by multiplying potential impact scores by the percentage of area occupied by the respective species in Europe. Finally, we correlated species' ecological traits with the derived impact scores. Alien mammals from the orders Rodentia, Artiodactyla, and Carnivora caused the highest impact. In particular, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), muskrat (Ondathra zibethicus), and sika deer (Cervus nippon) had the highest overall scores. Species with a high potential environmental impact also had a strong potential economic impact. Potential impact also correlated with the distribution of a species in Europe. Ecological flexibility (measured as number of different habitats a species occupies) was strongly related to impact. The scoring system was robust to uncertainty in knowledge of impact and could be adjusted with weight scores to account for specific value systems of particular stakeholder groups (e.g., agronomists or environmentalists). Finally, the scoring system is easily applicable and adaptable to other taxonomic groups.},

In this paper, we show how the sampling method most often used to parameterize an ecological community, can affect the conclusions about whether or not complexity promotes stability and we suggest a sampling algorithm that overcomes the problem. We also illustrate the importance of treating feasibility separately from stability when constructing model communities. Using model Lotka-Volterra competition communities we found that probability of feasibility decreases with increasing interaction strength and number of species in the community. However, for feasible systems we found that local stability probability and resilience do not significantly differ between communities with few or many species, in contrast with earlier studies that, did not account for feasibility and concluded that species-poor communities had higher probability of being locally stable than species-rich communities.

  volume = {111},
  issn = {1600-0706},
  abstract = {Many investigations in current ecological research focus on ecological functions, the functions of biodiversity, or the functioning of ecological systems. However, within ecology ``function'' is used in several different meanings. The most important ones are those of function as denoting either processes, roles, services or the ``functioning'' of whole systems. Some of these meanings pose considerable problems in terms of their ability to apply them in empirical research. These problems together with the ambiguity of the term ``function'' constitute considerable impediments for generalizations of research results. In order to improve this situation, the current paper describes the different meanings of ``function'' and discusses the requirements necessary to unambiguously apply the concept(s) in practice. This is illustrated by the example of current discussions on the ``functions of biodiversity''.},

Recently, it was shown that this is not necessarily true in competitive ecosystems. We investigated the stability of random ecosystems and found that it can largely be predicted by simple matrix statistics such as the mean and the variance of the interaction coefficients. We use this to explain why stability can increase as well as decrease with complexity in ecological communities. We argue that the variance, and to a lesser extent the mean, of the interaction coefficients go a long way in explaining patterns in the stability of ecosystems.},

  annote = {Motivated by experiments in electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals with homeotropic alignment we study the coupled amplitude equations describing the formation of a stationary roll pattern in the presence of a weakly damped mode that breaks isotropy. The equations can be generalized to describe the planarly aligned case if the orienting effect of the boundaries is small, which can be achieved by a destabilizing magnetic field. The slow mode represents the in-plane director at the center of the cell. The simplest uniform states are normal rolls, which may undergo a pitchfork bifurcation to abnormal rolls with a misaligned in-plane director. We present a new class of defect-free solutions with spatial modulations perpendicular to the rolls. In a parameter range where the zigzag instability is not relevant these solutions are stable attractors, as observed in experiments. We also present two-dimensionally modulated states with and without defects which result from the destabilization of the one-dimensionally modulated structures. Finally, for no (or very small) damping, and away from the rotationally symmetric case, we find static chevrons made up of a periodic arrangement of defect chains (or bands of defects) separating homogeneous regions of oblique rolls with very small amplitude.

  shorttitle = {Indirect {{Effects}} in {{Marine Rocky Intertidal Interaction Webs}}},
  abstract = {To determine the patterns of occurrence and importance of indirect effects relative to direct effects in natural communities, I analyzed experimentally based studies from 23 rocky intertidal habitats. The vehicle of analysis was the construction of interaction webs, or the subset of species in food webs involved in strong interactions. The analysis focused on indirect effects involving changes in abundance, or interaction chains, since little information was available on other types of indirect effects (behavioral, chemical response, environmental). As expected, number of direct (= strong) interactions, indirect effects, interaction sequences producing indirect effects, and types of indirect effects (e.g., keystone predation, apparent competition, etc.) all increased with web species richness. Less expected, when these measures were adjusted to a per species basis, positive relationships with species richness were still observed for all measures but the number of types. In other words, with increasing web diversity, each species interacted strongly with more species, was involved in more indirect effects, and was part of more interaction pathways. The analysis identified 83 subtypes of indirect effect, including the seven previously identified types. Many of the 76 additional types could be reclassified into the seven types if the original definitions of these @'classic@' types were expanded to include interactions having similar effects but differing in the specific mechanism (e.g., both interference competition and inhibition of recruitment [preemption] have negative effects involving a spatial resource). Two new types of indirect effect, termed @'apparent predation@' and @'indirect defense@' were also identified, producing a total of 9 general types of indirect effect divided among 565 specific indirect effects. Of these, keystone predation (35\%) and apparent competition (25\%) were most common and exploitation competition (2.8\%) was least common in these webs. Two methods of analysis suggested that indirect effects accounted for @?40\% of the change in community structure resulting from manipulations, with a range of 24-61\%. The proportion of change due to indirect effects was constant with web species richness, indicating that strong direct interactions and indirect effects produce roughly the same level of alteration of community structure regardless of the level of web complexity. Several potential artifacts and biases were evaluated. Most importantly, neither variation in level of taxonomic resolution nor intensity of experimentation varied significantly with web size (species richness). Despite a bias toward manipulation of consumers over manipulation of basal species, some predator-initiated indirect effect types were scarce while some basal species-initiated types were common. While the frequency of exploitation competition may have been underestimated, it is unlikely that the frequency of this indirect effect would change dramatically: changes due to this effect should have been detected in many of the studies and reported; and the most intensively studied individual webs did not report frequencies differing much from the average. This analysis suggests investigators effectively identified and first manipulated those species responsible for most indirect effects and that more experiments added decreasing numbers of indirect effects. Moreover, the frequencies and importance of indirect effects may be more predictable than expected on the basis of theory.},

To evaluate this hypothesis, I review the literature on selection experiments in heterogeneous environments. The niche width usually - but not invariably - evolves to match the amount of environmental variation, specialists evolving in homogeneous environments and generalists evolving in heterogeneous environments. The genetics of niche width are more complex than has previously been recognized, particularly with respect to the magnitude of costs of adaptation and the putative constraints on the evolution of generalists. Genetic variation in fitness is more readily maintained in heterogeneous environments than in homogeneous environments and this diversity is often stably maintained through negative frequency-dependent selection. Moreover environmental heterogeneity appears to be a plausible mechanism for at least two well-known patterns of species diversity at the landscape scale. I conclude that environmental heterogeneity is a plausible and possibly very general explanation for diversity across the range of scales from individuals to landscapes.}

This framework connects many seemingly unrelated ecological population models and allows for quantitative predictions to be made about the impact of niche stabilizing and destabilizing forces on population extinction times and abundance distributions. In particular, the existence of niche stabilizing forces in our blended framework can simultaneously resolve two major problems with the dynamics of neutral theory, namely predictions of species lifetimes that are too short and species ages that are too long.},

  copyright = {Copyright \textcopyright{} 1994 Annual Reviews},
  issn = {0066-4162},
  abstract = {Indirect effects occur when the impact of one species on another requires the presence of a third species. They can arise in two general ways: through linked chains of direct interactions, and when a species changes the interactions among species. Indirect effects have been uncovered largely by experimental studies that have monitored the response of many species and discovered "unexpected results," although some studies have looked for specific indirect effects predicted from simple models. The characteristics of such approaches make it likely that the many indirect effects remain uncovered, but the application of techniques such as path analysis may reduce this problem. Deterministic theory indicates that indirect effects should often be important, although stochastic models need exploration. Simulation models indicate that some indirect effects may stabilize multi-species assemblages. Five simple types of indirect effects have been regularly demonstrated in nature: exploitative competition, trophic cascades, apparent competition, indirect mutualism, and interaction modifications. Detailed experimental investigations of natural communities have yielded complicated effects. Indirect effects have the potential to affect evolutionary patterns, but empirical examples are limited. Future directions in the study of indirect effects include developing techniques to estimate interaction strength in dynamic models, deriving more efficient approaches to detecting indirect effects, evaluating the effectiveness of approaches such as path analysis, and investigating mechanisms in which a species changes how other species interact.},

EU member states are also committed to reach Good Environmental Status by 2020 through the Marine Strategy Framework Directive which aims to protect all ecosystem services. So, how will fisheries management measures contribute to ecosystem functioning and the attainment of environmental objectives as measured by improvements in indicators of biodiversity and food webs? We model ecosystem effects of fishing in the North Sea using food web model projections incorporating fishing effort strategies consistent with MSY targets. Correlations between modelled indicators and survey data were significant ( p {$\leq$} 0.02 ). Reduced fishing effort led to increases in size-based indicators and biomasses of benthivores, planktivores and piscivores. However, predation by piscivores depressed bentho-piscivore biomass. Climate warming may also decrease biomasses of bentho-piscivores and piscivores, while planktivores, benthivores and state indicators of size and trophic level may increase. Fisheries management measures will benefit the biodiversity of the fish community in terms of size structure, but not necessarily the food web since decreases in relative biomass of some trophic guilds are expected.},

One consequence of this is that the 'noise' and other low frequency components of the electrode signal are suppressed. Hitherto, the possibility that they may carry potentially useful information has been overlooked, but there are studies which show that information regarding the flow regime can be identified by spectral analysis of the higher frequency or 'noise' components of the sensor signals from some other types of flowmeters. If the entire electrode signal is analysed, using well-established signal analysis methods, diagnostic information regarding the flow regime in which the flowmeter is operating can be recovered and several distinctly different flow regimes can be identified, such as increased turbulence, swirling flow, flow pulsations and two-phase flow, all of which adversely affect the performance of the flowmeter. This paper presents the results of laboratory simulations of these flow regimes and describes a fuzzy logic method for identifying them. It also suggests a change to the conventional mode of operation and signal processing which would enable the additional functions to be implemented without involving any modification to the design or construction of the conventional flowtube. The potential benefits which arise from its application include the identification of flow regimes which adversely affect the performance of the flowmeter in its installed position and the ability to verify, on line, that the flowmeter is functioning correctly}

  abstract = {Theoretical studies of the stability of food webs have generally not incorporated space as a contingency affecting coexistence of species. Here, I considered the importance of spatial heterogeneity on the stability of an individual-based food web model. Individual agents diffused on a lattice of cells and interacted according to a set of probabilistic interaction coefficients. Simulations were run on both uniform and non-uniform lattices. The model had two modes: 1. a mean-field mode with global interactions, and 2. a spatially localized mode in which species interacted within local neighborhoods. Equilibrium number of species were compared among different simulations varying web connectance, interaction strength, and lattice heterogeneity. Local interactions resulted in more species rich webs, indicating greater stability. The addition of spatial heterogeneity to the lattice further altered relationships among species richness, web connectance, and interaction strength, and increased coexistence among species. The results did not support the stability criterion derived by May. However, an inverse relationship between web connectance and species richness was observed suggesting that the product of connectance and species richness may govern the stability of real, finite webs.

  volume = {36},
  issn = {0044-7447},
  abstract = {Abstract Eutrophication of the Baltic Sea has potentially increased the frequency and magnitude of cyanobacteria blooms. Eutrophication leads to increased sedimentation of organic material, increasing the extent of anoxic bottoms and subsequently increasing the internal phosphorus loading. In addition, the hypoxic water volume displays a negative relationship with the total dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool, suggesting greater overall nitrogen removal with increased hypoxia. Enhanced internal loading of phosphorus and the removal of dissolved inorganic nitrogen leads to lower nitrogen to phosphorus ratios, which are one of the main factors promoting nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria blooms. Because cyanobacteria blooms in the open waters of the Baltic Sea seem to be strongly regulated by internal processes, the effects of external nutrient reductions are scale-dependent. During longer time scales, reductions in external phosphorus load may reduce cyanobacteria blooms; however, on shorter time scales the internal phosphorus loading can counteract external phosphorus reductions. The coupled processes inducing internal loading, nitrogen removal, and the prevalence of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can qualitatively be described as a potentially self-sustaining ``vicious circle.'' To effectively reduce cyanobacteria blooms and overall signs of eutrophication, reductions in both nitrogen and phosphorus external loads appear essential.},

A projection model was elaborated where annual variations in the composition of catches by sex and age were taken into account. Grey seals decreased from 88 000-100 000 in the beginning of the century to approximately 4000 in the late 1970s. The Baltic ringed seal population decreased during the same period from 190 000-220 000 to approximately 5000. In the mid-1960s, the remaining populations were afflicted by sterility, probably caused by organochlorines, which inhibited natural growth during a 25-years period. Thus, the decrease in seal numbers was a consequence of excessive hunting, but the present low numbers are due to lowered fertility rates after 1965.},

The algorithm is based on the conventional comb-filtering technique, and utilizes the harmonicity of the spectrum. When an input signal consists of harmonic signals with different fundamental frequencies, if is difficult to estimate the fundamental frequencies using conventional methods. In order to overcome the above disadvantage, first we show a new method for modeling input signal, and propose an algorithm for extracting the fundamental frequency from the harmonic frequencies. Finally experimental results show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. (8 References).}

Seasonality and number of resources become the main factors limiting the number of coexisting species.},

  abstract = {An effective bibliometric analysis based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) published by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) was carried out to identify wetland research between 1991 and 2008. The objective was to conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis for global trends of wetland-related research. The characteristics related to publications were analyzed. The results showed the significant wetland research issues in the SCI database. From 1991 to 2008, the annual number of journal articles published and the number of articles cited to wetland research increased more than sixfold and ninefold respectively. The USA produced the most single-country articles and international collaborative articles, followed by Canada and UK. The results also showed the significant wetland research issues in SCI database. The most frequently used words were: ``water'' (or ``water quality''), which ranked 3rd, 7th, and 3rd according to the word in article title, author keyword, and keyword plus analysis, respectively. Constructed wetland biodiversity became more active in wetland research. The keywords ``constructed wetland'' and ``constructed wetlands'' ranked 58th and 12th in 1991\textendash{}1996, while they ranked 5th and 4th in 2003\textendash{}2008; the author keyword ``biodiversity'' ranked 45th in 1991\textendash{}1996, while it ranked 23rd in 1997\textendash{}2002, and 14th in 2003\textendash{}2008; and keyword plus ``diversity'' ranked 93rd in 1991\textendash{}1996, while it ranked 20th in 1997\textendash{}2002, and 17th in 2003\textendash{}2008. Moreover, it was proved that article title, author keyword, and keyword plus analysis methods were effective approaches for mapping wetland research. Popular wetland research issues and wetland research changes were also identified by statistical analysis.},

A variety of theoretical explanations have been put forward to explain one, or more, of these patterns; for example, five reasons have been advanced for why food chains are short. Two bodies of theory each satisfactorily account for a majority (but not all) of the patterns, but draw on very different assumptions. One group of theoretical explanations is based on dynamic interactions between species, modelled by Lotka-Volterra equations. The other takes a static view of food web assembly, and assumes a trophic cascade, or hierarchy of feeding links, in which species body sizes appear to play a crucial role. On present evidence, it is not possible to distinguish between the relative contributions of either of these possibilities in the creation of structure in real food webs.}

  abstract = {1. The main impacts on marine ecosystems are summarised and the potential for their restoration is discussed in relation to their key features. Rocky shores, seagrass beds and disused docks are focused on. 2. The term restoration is used to describe intervention in the recovery process of a marine ecosystem, with a view to enhancing the process, but not necessarily forcing the system to recover to its original condition. 3. Rocky shore systems are subject to shellfish and seaweed exploitation, point source pollution, diffuse impacts such as tributyl tin and acute impacts such as oil spills. The consideration of whether to employ restoration or allow natural recovery is discussed in relation to these systems. 4. Seagrass systems have suffered serious declines in many parts of the world due to the direct and indirect effects of human impacts. In the North Atlantic a wasting disease first noted in the 1930s caused a serious decline in the subtidal seagrass Zostera marina. The link between this disease and the marine slime mould Labrynthula zosterae is now well established. Human impacts on seagrass systems allow the disease to gain a foothold. Attempts at restoring seagrass beds have met with some success, but it is suggested that the action of conservation of remaining beds and better management of human activities may be the best approach. 5. Disused docks occur in many parts of Britain and Europe. Active management of the physical environment by mixing and biomanipulation by filter feeding organisms have led to improvements in water quality and ecosystem function. Thus healthy marine ecosystems have been restored to inner city areas, although these artificial marine lakes have few natural equivalents and are different from the original ecosystem at the site. 6. When compared to freshwater ecosystems, the scope for coastal and marine restoration is limited although the capacity for recovery is greater.

  abstract = {Adapted from the weed risk assessment (WRA) of Pheloung, Williams, and Halloy, the fish invasiveness scoring kit (FISK) was proposed as a screening tool for freshwater fishes. This article describes improvements to FISK, in particular the incorporation of confidence (certainty/uncertainty) ranking of the assessors' responses, and reports on the calibration of the score system, specifically: determination of most appropriate score thresholds for classifying nonnative species into low-, medium-, and high-risk categories, assessment of the patterns of assessors' confidences in their responses in the FISK assessments. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, FISK was demonstrated to distinguish accurately (and with statistical confidence) between potentially invasive and noninvasive species of nonnative fishes, with the statistically appropriate threshold score for high-risk species scores being {$\geq$}19. Within the group of species classed as high risk using this new threshold, a ``higher risk'' category could be visually identified, at present consisting of two species (topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva and gibel carp Carassius gibelio). FISK represents a useful and viable tool to aid decision- and policymakers in assessing and classifying freshwater fishes according to their potential invasiveness.},

The model appears suited to other community types that satisfy these conditions, and suggests that trophic processes are complementary to competitive displacement in determining that particle density is a linear function of the logarithm of particle size.},

  abstract = {Assessing benthic quality status of marine and transitional water habitats requires to set up both: (i) tools (i.e. indices) to assess the relative quality of the considered habitat, and (ii) reference conditions for which such indices can be computed and used to infer the absolute ecological status (ES) of the considered habitat. The development of indices, their comparison and the assessment of the causes of their discrepancies have been largely discussed but less attention has been paid to the methods used for the setting of adequate reference conditions, although this step is clearly crucial for the sound assessment of ES. This contribution reviews the approaches available in setting both reference conditions (pristine areas, hindcasting, modelling and best professional judgment) and targets (baseline set in the past, current baseline and directional/trends). We scored the use of pristine or minimally impacted conditions as the best single method; however, the other methods were judged as adequate then combined with best professional judgment. The case of multivariate AMBI (AZTI's Marine Biotic Index) is used to highlight the importance of setting correct reference conditions. Hence, data from 29 references, including 14 countries from Europe and North America, and both coastal (15 cases) and transitional (17 cases) waters, have been used to study the response of multivariate AMBI to human pressures. Results show that the inability of this index to detect human pressure is in most cases linked with the use of inappropriate methods for setting reference conditions.},

This study attempts to assess the impacts of invasive alien phytoplankton in the Baltic Sea during 1980\textendash{}2008. A bioinvasion impact assessment method (BPL \textendash{} biopollution level index) was applied to phytoplankton monitoring data collected from eleven sub-regions of the Baltic Sea. BPL takes into account abundance and distribution range of an alien species and the magnitude of the impact on native communities, habitats and ecosystem functioning. Of the 12 alien/cryptogenic phytoplankton species recorded in the Baltic Sea only one (the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum) was categorized as an IAS, causing a recognizable environmental effect.},

Archetypes may be more appropriate than KL when the data do not have elliptical distributions, and are often well-suited to studying regimes in which the system spends a long time near a "steady" state, punctuated with quick excursions to outliers in the data set, which may represent intermittency.

Without adaptive foragers, food-web complexity destabilizes community composition; whereas in their presence, complexity may enhance community persistence through facilitation of dynamical food-web reconstruction that buffers environmental fluctuations.

  annote = {Describes a method used to extract fundamental frequencies of speech signals for use in speech analysis-synthesis systems. The method is based on peak-picking of squared and filtered speech waveforms. The following two-filter characteristics are tried: (1) sin/sup 2/( omega tau /2)/( omega tau /2), (2) j omega a/(j omega +a)/sup 2/. Both filters are used in cascade with a low pass filter, the unit response curve of which is the same as the Hamming window function. A new peak-picking method and a new period decision logic are also developed. In order to evaluate this method, gross pitch errors, unvoiced-to-voiced errors and voiced-to-unvoiced errors are calculated for the two filter characteristics. A A/B preference test is also conducted on speech samples which are LPC analyzed and synthesized. A female voice, a male voice and a telephone-band-limited male voice are used as the test samples. It is concluded that the method proposed has a higher preference score than the cepstral method, and that in the case of the telephone-band-limited voice, the second filter is preferable to the first one.

Policy drivers for integrating environmental and fishery management in Europe have never been so strong. Scientists calling for better integration now have the opportunity to help deliver it. The main challenge is providing relevant evidence on short time-scales using existing knowledge. Policies, scientists, and society largely agree that management targets should be linked to achieving sustainability, but research often fails to show when fishing impacts `matter' in relation to sustainability criteria. If targets for ecosystem functions or processes are to complement more tractable targets for species and habitats, scientists will need to show why impacts `matter' and when they become unsustainable. For now, and to meet ambitious and pressing policy timetables, priority should be given to developing credible targets for impacts with a high risk of compromising sustainability, rather than dissipating research and advisory effort to achieve broader coverage of state, function, and process. Impacts on sensitive species and habitats often compromise sustainability; thus, setting targets for them is a priority. Meeting these targets will often require management measures that are expected to diminish risks of other unsustainable impacts. Fast and significant progress towards integration could be achieved by incorporating measures to meet environmental targets for sensitive species and habitats into fishery management plans.},

The energy spectrum is calculated by a statistical model in which the pulses with a fixed shape are lined up in the way that each distance is independent of others. This model reproduces a peak near the wavenumber k=1/ square root 2 as well as the flat part near k=0 in the energy spectrum.

  volume = {9},

  abstract = {The Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries requires that managers take account of the environmental impacts of fishing. We develop linked state and pressure indicators that show the impact of bottom-trawling on benthic communities. The state indicator measures the proportion of an area where benthic invertebrate biomass (B) or production (P) is more than 90\% of pristine benthic biomass (B 0.9) or production (P0.9). The pressure indicator measures the proportion of the area where trawling frequency is sufficiently high to prevent reaching predicted B0.9 or P0.9. Time to recovery to B0.9 and P0.9 after trawling, depending on the habitat, was estimated using a validated size-based model of the benthic community. Based on trawling intensity in 2003, 53.5\% of the southern North Sea was trawled too frequently for biomass to reach B0.9, and 27.1\% was trawled too frequently for production to reach P0.9. As a result of bottom-trawling in 2003, in 56\% of the southern North Sea benthic biomass was below B0.9, whereas in 27\% of the southern North Sea benthic production was below P0.9. Modeled recovery times were comparable to literature estimates (2.5 to more than 6 years). The advantages of using the area with an ecological impact of trawling as a pressure indicator are that it is conceptually easy to understand, it responds quickly to changes in management action, it can be implemented at a relevant scale for fisheries management, and the necessary effort distribution data are centrally collected. One of this approach's greatest utilities, therefore, will be to communicate to policy makers and fishing enterprises the expected medium- to long-term ecological benefits that will accrue if the frequency of trawling in particular parts of fishing grounds is reduced.},

  volume = {14},
  issn = {1432-9840, 1435-0629},
  abstract = {The enormity and complexity of problems like environmental degradation and biodiversity loss have led to the development of indicator species and other surrogate approaches to track changes in environments and/or in biodiversity. Under these approaches particular species or groups of species are used as proxies for other biota, particular environmental conditions, or for environmental change. The indicator species approach contrasts with a direct measurement approach in which the focus is on a single entity or a highly targeted subset of entities in a given ecosystem but no surrogacy relationships with unmeasured entities are assumed. Here, we present a broad philosophical discussion of the indicator species and direct measurement approaches because their relative advantages and disadvantages are not well understood by many researchers, resource managers and policy makers. A goal of the direct measurement approach is to demonstrate a causal relationship between key attributes of the target ecosystem system (for example, particular environmental conditions) and the entities selected for measurement. The key steps in the approach are based on the fundamental scientific principles of hypothesis testing and associated direct measurement that drive research activities, management activities and monitoring programs. The direct measurement approach is based on four critical assumptions:(1) the `right' entities to measure have been selected, (2) these entities are well known, (3) there is sufficient understanding about key ecological processes and (4) the entities selected can be accurately measured. The direct measurement approach is reductionist and many elements of the biota, many biotic processes and environmental factors must be ignored because of practical considerations. The steps in applying the indicator species approach are broadly similar to the direct measurement approach, except surrogacy relationships also must be quantified between a supposed indicator species or indicator group and the factors for which it is purported to be a proxy. Such quantification needs to occur via: (1) determining the taxonomic, spatial and temporal bounds for which a surrogacy relationship does and does not hold. That is, the extent of transferability of a given surrogate such as an indicator species to other biotic groups, to landscapes, ecosystems, environmental circumstances or over time in the same location can be determined; and (2) determining the ecological mechanisms underpinning a surrogacy relationship (for example, through fundamental studies of community structure). Very few studies have rigorously addressed these two tasks, despite the extremely widespread use of the indicator species approach and similar kinds of surrogate schemes in virtually all fields of environmental, resource and conservation management. We argue that this has the potential to create significant problems; thus, the use of an indicator species approach needs to be better justified. Attempts to quantify surrogacy relationships may reveal that, in some circumstances, the alternative of direct measurement of particular entities of environmental or conservation interest will be the best option.},

  abstract = {1. We used long-term data and a simulation model to investigate temporal fluctuations in zebra mussel populations, which govern the ecological and economic impacts of this pest species. 2. The size of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population in the Hudson River estuary fluctuated approximately 11-fold across a 13-year period, following a cycle with a 2\textendash{}4~year period. 3. This cycling was caused by low recruitment during years of high adult population size, rapid somatic growth of settled animals, and adult survivorship of 50\% per year. 4. Adult growth and body condition were weakly correlated with phytoplankton biomass. 5. The habitat distribution of the Hudson's population changed over the 13-year period, with an increasing proportion of the population spreading onto soft sediments over time. The character of soft-sediment habitats in the Hudson changed because of large amounts (mean~=~34~g DM~m-2) of empty zebra mussel shells now in the sediments. 6. Simulation models show that zebra mussel populations can show a range of long-term trajectories, depending on the balance between adult space limitation, larval food limitation, and disturbance. 7. Effective understanding and management of the effects of zebra mussels and other alien species depend on understanding of their long-term demography, which may vary across ecosystems.},

As a consequence, the maximum achievable biomass is independent of body size, and is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the biomass in natural populations. The minimum interorganismic terorganismic distance, calculated from the maximum density to allow comparison between aquatic and terrestrial organisms, scales as the 1/3 power of body size in both habitats. The similarities in the interorganismic distance of terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal communities suggest a fundamental regularity in the way organisms use the space.}

  volume = {16},
  issn = {1051-0761},
  shorttitle = {Setting Expectations for the Ecological Condition of Streams},
  abstract = {An important component of the biological assessment of stream condition is an evaluation of the direct or indirect effects of human activities or disturbances. The concept of a ``reference condition'' is increasingly used to describe the standard or benchmark against which current condition is compared. Many individual nations, and the European Union as a whole, have codified the concept of reference condition in legislation aimed at protecting and improving the ecological condition of streams. However, the phrase ``reference condition'' has many meanings in a variety of contexts. One of the primary purposes of this paper is to bring some consistency to the use of the term. We argue the need for a ``reference condition'' term that is reserved for referring to the ``naturalness'' of the biota (structure and function) and that naturalness implies the absence of significant human disturbance or alteration. To avoid the confusion that arises when alternative definitions of reference condition are used, we propose that the original concept of reference condition be preserved in this modified form of the term: ``reference condition for biological integrity,'' or RC(BI). We further urge that these specific terms be used to refer to the concepts and methods used in individual bioassessments to characterize the expected condition to which current conditions are compared: ``minimally disturbed condition'' (MDC); ``historical condition'' (HC); ``least disturbed condition'' (LDC); and ``best attainable condition'' (BAC). We argue that each of these concepts can be narrowly defined, and each implies specific methods for estimating expectations. We also describe current methods by which these expectations are estimated including: the reference-site approach (condition at minimally or least-disturbed sites); best professional judgment; interpretation of historical condition; extrapolation of empirical models; and evaluation of ambient distributions. Because different assumptions about what constitutes reference condition will have important effects on the final classification of streams into condition classes, we urge that bioassessments be consistent in describing the definitions and methods used to set expectations.},

  abstract = {The large fish indicator (LFI) was developed to support the North Sea fish community Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) pilot study, intended to establish an operational ecosystem approach to management. Subsequently, procedures established in the North Sea were applied to the Celtic Sea to derive an LFI and target specific to this region. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires EU Member States sharing marine regions to cooperate using the Regional Seas Conventions, and using indicators already adopted by them. The MSFD explicitly suggests the LFI as a foodweb indicator, but it could equally well be used to monitor biodiversity. Here, we apply the established rationale to develop an LFI and target specific to the southern Bay of Biscay. Despite declining in the 1990s, the LFI subsequently recovered to near original values in 2008. Previously, relationships between the LFI and fishing pressure have involved lengthy time-lags. We observe a similar relationship, but with shorter lag. The nature of the larger species responsible for much of the change in the LFI may explain this difference, and might also suggest that, in the Bay of Biscay, the LFI is more appropriately used as a biodiversity indicator, rather than a foodweb indicator.},

In this review, we propose a unified framework for biological invasions that reconciles and integrates the key features of the most commonly used invasion frameworks into a single conceptual model that can be applied to all human-mediated invasions. The unified framework combines previous stage-based and barrier models, and provides a terminology and categorisation for populations at different points in the invasion process.},

However, there is little understanding of the relative importance of the various mechanisms proposed to influence home-range scaling (e.g., differences in realm productivity, thermoregulation, locomotion strategy, dimensionality, trophic guild, and prey size) and whether these extend beyond the commonly studied birds and mammals. We derive new home-range scaling relationships for fishes and reptiles and use a model-selection approach to evaluate the generality of home-range scaling mechanisms across 569 vertebrate species. We find no evidence that home-range allometry varies consistently between aquatic and terrestrial realms or thermoregulation strategies, but we find that locomotion strategy, foraging dimension, trophic guild, and prey size together explain 80\% of the variation in h...},

  abstract = {A complex controversy emerged when the grey seal population in the Baltic Sea recovered after decades of stagnation. The seals now cause substantial economic losses to coastal fisheries. The paper analyses the attempts taken in Finland to mitigate the problems of fishermen. The mitigation attempts include the hunting of seals, fishing technology development, economic compensations and more comprehensive management approaches. These measures are discussed in light of the long-term sustainability and adaptability of a coastal fishery. This question is important with respect to further discussions on the possibility of the coastal fishery's co-existence with seals and sheds light on more general goals for the adaptability in the management of social\textendash{}ecological systems. The paper concludes that the more comprehensive measures taken have acknowledged the need to enhance the fishery's adaptability, but the managerial approach they represent falls short of the requirements for successful adaptive management, especially in terms of embedding the management into specific coastal contexts.},

According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species' productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.}

  abstract = {Competition and predation are the most heavily investigated species interactions in ecology, dominating studies of species diversity maintenance. However, these two interactions are most commonly viewed highly asymmetrically. Competition for resources is seen as the primary interaction limiting diversity, with predation modifying what competition does, although theoretical models have long supported diverse views. Here we show, using a comprehensive three-trophic-level model, that competition and predation should be viewed symmetrically: these two interactions are equally able to either limit or promote diversity. Diversity maintenance requires within-species density feedback loops to be stronger than between-species feedback loops. We quantify the contributions of predation and competition to these loops in a simple, interpretable form, showing their equivalent potential to strengthen or weaken diversity maintenance. Moreover, we show that competition and predation can undermine each other, with the tendency of the stronger interaction to promote or limit diversity prevailing. The past failure to appreciate the symmetrical effects and interactions of competition and predation has unduly restricted diversity maintenance studies. A multitrophic perspective should be adopted to examine a greater variety of possible effects of predation than generally considered in the past. Conservation and management strategies need to be much more concerned with the implications of changes in the strengths of trophic interactions.},

Simulated nutrient and oxygen concentrations as well as transport flows and major biogeochemical fluxes can be analyzed in many different ways, including construction of detailed nutrient budgets and tracing the fate of nutrient inputs. The large amounts of data that exist for this sea makes it possible to validate model results with observations. Major biogeochemical properties of the Baltic Sea are discussed through an analyses of model sensitivity to external forcing and internal parameterizations. Model results emphasize two features that are especially important for ecosystem management: i) impacts of local measures would always be modified by the long-range transports from other regions and ii) the response to significant changes in loads would only be seen after several decades.},

  abstract = {An era of expanding deep-ocean industrialization is before us, with policy makers establishing governance frameworks for sustainable management of deep-sea resources while scientists learn more about the ecological structure and functioning of the largest biome on the planet. Missing from discussion of the stewardship of the deep ocean is ecological restoration. If existing activities in the deep sea continue or are expanded and new deep-ocean industries are developed, there is need to consider what is required to minimize or repair resulting damages to the deep-sea environment. In addition, thought should be given as to how any past damage can be rectified. This paper develops the discourse on deep-sea restoration and offers guidance on planning and implementing ecological restoration projects for deep-sea ecosystems that are already, or are at threat of becoming, degraded, damaged or destroyed. Two deep-sea restoration case studies or scenarios are described (deep-sea stony corals on the Darwin Mounds off the west coast of Scotland, deep-sea hydrothermal vents in Manus Basin, Papua New Guinea) and are contrasted with on-going saltmarsh restoration in San Francisco Bay. For these case studies, a set of socio-economic, ecological, and technological decision parameters that might favor (or not) their restoration are examined. Costs for hypothetical restoration scenarios in the deep sea are estimated and first indications suggest they may be two to three orders of magnitude greater per hectare than costs for restoration efforts in shallow-water marine systems.},

  abstract = {Many models have been proposed that relate failure times and stochastic time-varying covariates. In some of these models, failure occurs when a particular observable marker crosses a threshold level. We are interested in the more difficult, and often more realistic, situation where failure is not related deterministically to an observable marker. In this case, joint models for marker evolution and failure tend to lead to complicated calculations for characteristics such as the marginal distribution of failure time or the joint distribution of failure time and marker value at failure. This paper presents a model based on a bivariate Wiener process in which one component represents the marker and the second, which is latent (unobservable), determines the failure time. In particular, failure occurs when the latent component crosses a threshold level. The model yields reasonably simple expressions for the characteristics mentioned above and is easy to fit to commonly occurring data that involve the marker value at the censoring time for surviving cases and the marker value and failure time for failing cases. Parametric and predictive inference are discussed, as well as model checking. An extension of the model permits the construction of a composite marker from several candidate markers that may be available. The methodology is demonstrated by a simulated example and a case application.},

This paper addresses the conflict between the conservation of a formerly endangered species, the gray seal, and professional fishermen, whose livelihoods are affected by both seal-induced damage and salmon fisheries management. We develop a bioeconomic model that incorporates the age structure of Atlantic salmon and gray seal populations. To determine the social optimum, we maximize the discounted net present value of the trap net fishery, taking into account the presence of seals in the form of seal-induced losses, which we describe using a damage function. By choosing the optimal combination of fishing gear over time, we obtain the socially optimal fishing efforts, salmon stock size, and salmon catch. In addition, we study the private effects of introducing a technology subsidy aimed at mitigating the seal-salmon conflict. The results suggest that technological adaptation would effectively reduce the cause of the conflict, while a technology subsidy encouraging such adaptation would shift the economic responsibility from individual fishermen to the broader public.},

These include the physical driving forces that created and continue to shape the Everglades and patterns and processes of its flora and fauna. The book summarizes recent studies of the region's vegetation, alligators, wading birds, and endangered species such as the snail kite and Florida panther. This referee-reviewed volume is the product of collaboration among 58 international authors from 27 institutional affiliations over nearly five years.The book concludes with a synthesis of system-wide restoration hypotheses, as they apply to the Everglades, that represent the integration and a collective viewpoint from the preceding 30 chapters. Techniques and systems learned here can be applied to ecosystems around the world.},

  abstract = {Nutrient load reductions are needed to improve the state of the Baltic Sea, but it is still under debate how they should be implemented. In this paper, we use data from an environmental valuation study conducted in all nine Baltic Sea states to investigate public preferences of relevance to three of the involved decision-dimensions: First, the roles of nitrogen versus phosphorus reductions causing different eutrophication effects; second, the role of time \textendash{} the lag between actions to reduce nutrient loads and perceived improvements; and third; the spatial dimension and the roles of actions targeting the coastal and open sea environment and different sub-basins. Our findings indicate that respondents view and value the Baltic Sea environment as a whole, and are not focussed only on their local sea area, or a particular aspect of water quality. We argue that public preferences concerning these three perspectives should be one of the factors guiding marine policy. This requires considering the entire range of eutrophication effects, in coastal and open sea areas, and including long-term and short-term measures.},

We test the hypothesis that a constant predator/prey ratio can be generated by what Holt (1977) terms lsquoapparent competitionrsquo and what Jeffries and Lawton (1984) call lsquocompetition for enemy-free spacersquo. We create simple, two trophic-level communities by drawing species of predators and prey at random from a species pool, simulating their interactions using Lotka-Volterra models. The simulated food webs converge over successive periods of invasion and extinction to locally stable systems with approximately constant ratios of number of predator species/number of prey species, despite varying initial conditions. As expected, predator/prey ratios take different values depending upon the lsquobiologyrsquo of the simulated species. We conclude that apparent competition between prey species via shared enemies may be one mechanism whereby approximately constant predator/prey ratios are generated in natural communities.},

  abstract = {Empirical evidence suggesting that living systems might operate in the vicinity of critical points, at the borderline between order and disorder, has proliferated in recent years, with examples ranging from spontaneous brain activity to flock dynamics. However, a well-founded theory for understanding how and why interacting living systems could dynamically tune themselves to be poised in the vicinity of a critical point is lacking. Here we use tools from statistical mechanics and information theory to show that complex adaptive or evolutionary systems can be much more efficient in coping with diverse heterogeneous environmental conditions when operating at criticality. Analytical as well as computational evolutionary and adaptive models vividly illustrate that a community of such systems dynamically self-tunes close to a critical state as the complexity of the environment increases while they remain noncritical for simple and predictable environments. A more robust convergence to criticality emerges in coevolutionary and coadaptive setups in which individuals aim to represent other agents in the community with fidelity, thereby creating a collective critical ensemble and providing the best possible tradeoff between accuracy and flexibility. Our approach provides a parsimonious and general mechanism for the emergence of critical-like behavior in living systems needing to cope with complex environments or trying to efficiently coordinate themselves as an ensemble.},

  abstract = {Global biodiversity is in decline. This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and {$>$}16,000 nonexperimental, local-scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5\textendash{}261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species' invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.},

  volume = {61},
  issn = {0924-7963},
  abstract = {The ecosystem of the Gulf of Finland is currently dominated by internal phosphorus loading from sediments. The internal load is highly redox sensitive, and its successful modelling on basin-wide scale requires a simplified description of the sediment process. We present here an approach in which redox-sensitive sediment processes are directly linked to the decomposition of carbon instead of the oxygen concentration in near-bottom water. Mineralisation of organic carbon is known to be the major factor controlling sediment nutrient cycling, including denitrification and Fe(III) oxide reduction, giving rise to high phosphorus fluxes from anoxic sediments.

Our sediment process description requires only four main parameters, which are here identified by using in situ CO2, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) flux measurements carried out by G{\"o}teborg University landers. The model was tested with the aid of time series of denitrification and DIP flux rates measured in the western Gulf of Finland. Modelled near-bottom and surface nutrient concentrations were compared with monitoring data from both the eastern and western Gulf of Finland. The model simulations showed that the average net ecosystem production entering the sediment surface from the euphotic layer was 49 g C m- 2 a- 1. This organic load induced an average denitrification rate of 2.5~g N m- 2 a- 1 and DIP flux of 0.67~g P m- 2 a- 1, corresponding to 20,200~t P a- 1 for the whole Gulf of Finland. The model was able to describe the seasonality of denitrification and sediment DIP flux with high precision. Further, the modelled near-bottom and surface nutrient concentrations were compatible with the available data.

The results indicate that, on the scales important for coastal and open sea conditions, our simple sediment process description works well. The new tool will help us to use 3D models to study the effects of external load on the production and decomposition of organic matter, and on subsequent benthic nutrient fluxes.},

  volume = {114},
  issn = {0030-1299},
  abstract = {To explore how environmental variability may create non-random community structure, we simulated the assembly of model communities under varying levels of environmental variability. We assembled communities by creating a large pool of randomly constructed species, and then added species from this pool sequentially, allowing extinctions of invading and resident species to occur until the community became saturated. Because much current research on community structure focuses on single trophic levels, we constructed species pools consisting only of competitors. To compare with more realistic communities, we also created species pools with multiple trophic levels. For both types of communities, following assembly we calculated a variety of metrics of community structure, and five measures of community stability. Communities assembled under high environmental variability had fewer species, fewer and weaker interactions among species, and greater evenness in abundance of persisting species. For single trophic-level communities, community size was dictated primarily by competitive exclusion. In contrast, for multiple trophic-level communities, community size was increasingly limited by dynamical instabilities as environmental variability increased. Differences in community structure resulting from assembly under high environmental variability led to differences in community stability. According to two measures of stability related to population variability - the characteristic return rate to equilibrium and the coefficient of variation in individual species densities - stability increased for communities assembled under high environmental variability. In contrast, three additional measures of stability that are not directly related to population variability showed a variety of patterns, either increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant. Thus, communities assembled in highly variable environments are not necessarily generically more stable. Our results demonstrate that environmental variability can structure communities and affect their stability properties in non-trivial ways. Thus, when making predictions about the response of communities to future extinctions or environmental degradation, account should be given to the forces responsible for community structure.},

A compiled data set comprising 29{$\mkern1mu$}582 records of individual prey eaten at 21 locations by individual predators that spanned 10 orders of magnitude in mass and lived in marine environments ranging from the poles to the tropics was used to investigate the influence of predator size and environment on predator and prey size relationships. Linear mixed effects models demonstrated that predator\textendash{}prey mass ratios (PPMR) increased with predator mass. The amount of the increase varied among locations and predator species and individuals but was not significantly influenced by temperature, latitude, depth, or primary production. Increases in PPMR with predator mass implied nonlinear relationships between log body mass and trophic level and reductions in transfer efficiency with increasing body size. The results suggest that very general rules determine dominant trends in PPMR in diverse marine ecosystems, leading to the ubiquity of size-based trophic structuring and the consistency of observed relationships between the relative abundance of individuals and their body size.},

  abstract = {Several theoretical studies propose that biodiversity buffers ecosystem functioning against environmental fluctuations, but virtually all of these studies concern a single trophic level, the primary producers. Changes in biodiversity also affect ecosystem processes through trophic interactions. Therefore, it is important to understand how trophic interactions affect the relationship between biodiversity and the stability of ecosystem processes. Here we present two models to investigate this issue in ecosystems with two trophic levels. The first is an analytically tractable symmetrical plant-herbivore model under random environmental fluctuations, while the second is a mechanistic ecosystem model under periodic environmental fluctuations. Our analysis shows that when diversity affects net species interaction strength, species interactions - both competition among plants and plant-herbivore interactions - have a strong impact on the relationships between diversity and the temporal variability of total biomass of the various trophic levels. More intense plant competition leads to a stronger decrease or a lower increase in variability of total plant biomass, but plant-herbivore interactions always have a destabilizing effect on total plant biomass. Despite the complexity generated by trophic interactions, biodiversity should still act as biological insurance for ecosystem processes, except when mean trophic interaction strength increases strongly with diversity.},

  issn = {1054-3139, 1095-9289},
  abstract = {Maintenance of overall ecosystem complexity is perceived as critical to the sustainability of ecosystem use. The development of an operational basis for an ecosystem approach to fisheries, however, faces many difficulties. On the research side, the challenge is in defining proper long-term, ecosystem-related objectives; determining meaningful reference values and indicators for desirable or undesirable states of the ecosystem; and developing appropriate data collection, analytical tools and models. The ``viability'' concept developed in economics by Jean-Pierre Aubin can be used to assist in the definition, selection of, and interaction among long-term objectives at an ecosystem level. It recognizes that ecosystems are complex assemblages of interacting and self-organizing natural and human components that cannot be predicted. Viability models define an ensemble of ``viable states'', in contrast to undesirable states defined as such by ecological, economic, and/or social constraints. These constraints can be derived from fisheries objectives, conservation principles, scientific results of modelling, or precautionary principles, and correspond to limit reference points to be avoided. Viability theory does not attempt to choose any ``optimal solution'' according to given criteria, but selects ``viable evolutions''. These evolutions are compatible with the constraints in the sense that they satisfy them at each time and can be delineated by the viability kernel. The southern Benguela marine ecosystem is presented as a first attempt for the application of this theory. In defining ecosystem-based objectives (and related issues such as target reference points), it seems more difficult to reach consensus among stakeholders on what is desirable than on what is undesirable (e.g. biological or economic collapse, species extinction, displacement of local rural communities). Expressed in the negative form or as limit reference points, ecosystem-based constraints can be considered simultaneously with current target reference points, such as maximum sustainable yield, using viability models. The viability approach can help to progressively integrate ecosystem considerations, such as conservation, into fisheries management.},

We propose a refined and operational definition of GEnS, indicating the data and information needed to all parts of that definition. We indicate the options for determining when GEnS has been met, acknowledge the data and information needs for each option, and recommend a combination of existing quantitative targets and expert judgement. We think that the MSFD implementation needs to be less complex than shown for other similar directives, can be based largely on existing data and can be centred on the activities of the Regional Seas Conventions.},

We examine this supposition at a moderate spatial extent by comparing the richness patterns of the 217 butterfly species resident in California to those of plants, including all 5,902 vascular plant species and the 552 species known to be fed on by caterpillars. We also examine the relationships between plant/butterfly richness and 20 environmental variables. We found that although plant and butterfly diversities are positively correlated, multiple regression, path models, and spatial analysis indicate that once primary productivity (estimated by a water-energy variable, actual evapotranspiration) and topographical variability are incorporated into models, neither measure of plant richness has any relationship with butterfly richness. To examine whether butterflies with the most specialized diets follow the pattern found across all butterflies, we repeated the analyses for 37 species of strict monophages and their food plants and found that plant and butterfly richness were similarly weakly associated after incorporating the environmental variables. We conclude that plant diversity does not directly influence butterfly diversity but that both are probably responding to similar environmental factors.},

  volume = {274},
  issn = {0962-8452},
  abstract = {The mechanism for maintaining complex food webs has been a central issue in ecology because theory often predicts that complexity (higher the species richness, more the interactions) destabilizes food webs. Although it has been proposed that prey anti-predator defence may affect the stability of prey-predator dynamics, such studies assumed a limited and relatively simpler variation in the food-web structure. Here, using mathematical models, I report that food-web flexibility arising from prey anti-predator defence enhances community-level stability (community persistence and robustness) in more complex systems and even changes the complexity-stability relationship. The model analysis shows that adaptive predator-specific defence enhances community-level stability under a wide range of food-web complexity levels and topologies, while generalized defence does not. Furthermore, while increasing food-web complexity has minor or negative effects on community-level stability in the absence of defence adaptation, or in the presence of generalized defence, in the presence of predator-specific defence, the connectance-stability relationship may become unimodal. Increasing species richness, in contrast, always lowers community-level stability. The emergence of a positive connectance-stability relationship however necessitates food-web compartmentalization, high defence efficiency and low defence cost, suggesting that it only occurs under a restricted condition.},

  abstract = {Measures aimed at conservation or restoration of ecosystems are often seen as net-cost projects by governments and businesses because they are based on incomplete and often faulty cost-benefit analyses. After screening over 200 studies, we examined the costs (94 studies) and benefits (225 studies) of ecosystem restoration projects that had sufficient reliable data in 9 different biomes ranging from coral reefs to tropical forests. Costs included capital investment and maintenance of the restoration project, and benefits were based on the monetary value of the total bundle of ecosystem services provided by the restored ecosystem. Assuming restoration is always imperfect and benefits attain only 75\% of the maximum value of the reference systems over 20 years, we calculated the net present value at the social discount rates of 2\% and 8\%. We also conducted 2 threshold cum sensitivity analyses. Benefit-cost ratios ranged from about 0.05:1 (coral reefs and coastal systems, worst-case scenario) to as much as 35:1 (grasslands, best-case scenario). Our results provide only partial estimates of benefits at one point in time and reflect the lower limit of the welfare benefits of ecosystem restoration because both scarcity of and demand for ecosystem services is increasing and new benefits of natural ecosystems and biological diversity are being discovered. Nonetheless, when accounting for even the incomplete range of known benefits through the use of static estimates that fail to capture rising values, the majority of the restoration projects we analyzed provided net benefits and should be considered not only as profitable but also as high-yielding investments.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT.  An attempt to use viability models for studying marine ecosystems is proposed as a possible alternative to classical ecosystem modeling. Viability models do not consider optimal solutions but instead define all possible evolutions of a dynamical system under given constraints. Applied to marine ecosystems, a viability model is formulated based on the trophic coefficients of a mass-balanced model. This requires relatively few assumptions about the processes involved and can integrate uncertainty associated with the required estimates of input parameters. An iterative algorithm is proposed to calculate the viability kernel, i.e., the envelope of all viable trajectories of the ecosystem. An application to the Benguela ecosystem is presented, considering interactions between detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton, pelagic fish, demersal fish and fisheries. Results show how a viability kernel could be used to better define the healthy states of a marine ecosystem, by defining what states should be avoided. The paper discusses how viability models of trophic interactions could help to define a new ecosystem-based indicator for fisheries management. It then discusses how this approach can potentially contribute to a paradigm shift that is emerging in the management of renewable resources.},

  volume = {212},

  abstract = {The dynamical theory of food webs has been based typically on local stability analysis. The relevance of local stability to food web properties has been questioned because local stability holds only in the immediate vicinity of the equilibrium and provides no information about the size of the basin of attraction. Local stability does not guarantee persistence of food webs in stochastic environments. Moreover, local stability excludes more complex dynamics such as periodic and chaotic behaviors, which may allow persistence. Global stability and permanence could be better criteria of community persistence. Our simulation analysis suggests that these three stability measures are qualitatively consistent in that all three predict decreasing stability with increasing complexity. Some new predictions on how stability depends on food web configurations are generated here: a consumer-victim link has a smaller effect on the probabilities of stability, as measured by all three stability criteria, than a pair of recipient-controlled and donor-controlled links; a recipient-controlled link has a larger effect on the probabilities of local stability and permanence than a donor-controlled link, while they have the same effect on the probability of global stability; food webs with equal proportions of donor-controlled and recipient-con trolled links are less stable than those with different proportions.

Many methods to detect the fundamental frequency have been proposed in the past. However, we do not have a promising technique in any environment. In this paper we propose a new method to detect the fundamental frequency of speech signals in noisy environments, which is an improved version of the cepstrum method. Log spectral valleys are affected by noise, and the harmonics structure corrupted by noise has little period in high frequency domain. In the proposed method, these unnecessary parts in log spectrum are removed so that the harmonics structure is visualized. Simulation experiments suggest that the gross pitch error is lower in the proposed method than in the methods presented in the past. Particularly, the fundamental frequency of speech corrupted by periodic noise is accurately extracted by the proposed method. (6 References).}

Using basic information on abundance and distribution of alien species, we developed an index that classifies AS impacts on native species, communities, habitats and ecosystem functioning. This method can be used to evaluate impact at five different levels of biopollution, fitting within the existing schemes for water quality assessment. Both spatial and temporal comparisons are possible. The assessments may also be used to evaluate management performance where avoidance measures were necessary and assist in preventing further unwanted introductions. Such assessments made for the same areas over time provide opportunities for measuring change in biopollution. We have tested the method using four different well-studied areas within the Baltic Sea (brackish to freshwater environments) for two different times, 20 years apart. Further developments of the scheme may be needed to cover some specific cases and taxonomic groups according to their life history.},

  shorttitle = {Estuarine, Coastal and Marine Ecosystem Restoration},
  abstract = {This review presents recent concepts, understanding and experience of the restoration, recovery and human-mediated modification of estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems. It shows that these can be divided into four categories: natural recovery from a natural or anthropogenic change (whether adverse or otherwise); anthropogenic interventions in response to a degraded or anthropogenically changed environment; anthropogenic responses to a single stressor; and habitat enhancement or creation. A conceptual framework for restoration and recovery of marine marginal and semi-enclosed areas is presented after exploring and refining the plethora of terms used in restoration science and management. Examples of management action are given including managed realignment and the restoration of docks, biogenic reefs, saltmarsh, seagrass, beaches and upper estuarine water quality. We emphasise that although recovery techniques are worthwhile if they can be carried out, they rarely (if ever) fully replace lost habitat. Moreover, while they may have some success in marginal or semi-enclosed areas such as coastal bays, estuaries and fringing habitats, they are less relevant to open coastal and marine habitats. Therefore the best option available in the latter can only be to remove the stressor, as the cause of any change, to prevent other stressors from operating and to allow the conditions suitable for natural recovery. This review emphasises that whereas some ecological concepts related to restoration are well understood, for example, the nature of ecosystem structure and functioning, others such as carrying capacity, resilience and ecosystem goods and services are still poorly quantified for the marine and estuarine environments. The linking between these ecological concepts and the management framework is also relatively recent but is required to give a holistic approach to understanding, managing and manipulating these environments.},

Frequencies in the signal are extracted according to their dependence on different delays. The frequency estimation can be accomplished with short record length even in the case where the number of frequency components in the signal is unknown. Also it is capable of estimating the frequencies of a signal in the presence of noise. Furthermore, the proposed method estimates the parameters with less computation and high estimation accuracy. Simulation results are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison of estimation accuracy between the proposed method and the analysis by synthes!}

The problem is examined in terms of past research on Daphnia and Hydra, and takes into account estimates of ecological efficiency, population efficiency, and growth efficiency based on many laboratory experiments. It is shown that there may be distinct differences in the effects of removing different kinds of individuals from a prey population. The optimal system for a predator wishing to insure the continued availability of its prey is to take animals which are about to die anyway, i.e., to alter the natural pattern of mortality as little as possible. It is concluded, with some reservations, that predators in nature generally act in this manner. Conversely, if one's intent is to exterminate a prey species (e.g., an objectionable pest), the animals removed should be those which natural predators do not select.},

Defining Ki as the saturation density for the ith species and {$\alpha$}ij as the competition coefficient between species i and j, and Ni as the equilibrium density of species i, the number of species will be determined by N\=, K\=, alpha , var (K), the covariances among the {$\alpha$}'s, and the covariance between {$\alpha$} and N. In particular, the number of species increases as K\= increases but as N\=, alpha , cov ({$\alpha$}), cov ({$\alpha$},N) and variance of K decrease.},

  volume = {259},
  abstract = {We consider an individual-based spatial model of a generic host-pathogen system and explore the differences between such models and mean-field systems. We find a range of new dynamical and evolutionary phenomena, in particular: (i) in this system, selective pressure is substantially reduced compared with the corresponding mean-field models, and artificial suppression of the pathogen population leads to faster evolution and reduces evolutionary stability; (ii) unlike the mean-field models, there exists a critical transmissibility {$\tau$} \textsubscript{c} above which the pathogen dies out; and (iii) the system displays self-evolved criticality. If the transmissibility {$\tau$} is allowed to mutate, it evolves to the critical value {$\tau$} \textsubscript{c}. Thus the system evolves to put itself at the boundary at which it can exist. Observations of the individual-based spatial model motivate an explanation for these phenomena in terms of the dynamics of host patches involving their connections and disconnections. We therefore construct a patch model of this and show that this simplified model behaves in a similar way to the individual-based spatial model.},

It draws  on much of the SCOPE programme on the ecology of biological invasions,  in which the author has been intimately involved for some years. It  also draws on the author's many years of experience teaching in the  subject. Several superb colour plates of key invasive species are  included and the book discusses the vital questions raised by  biological control and the release of genetically modified organisms.},

To do so, we conducted an online survey. The 937 respondents were mostly early-career scientists who studied biology as undergraduates. We found a clear self-perceived lack of quantitative training: 75\% were not satisfied with their understanding of mathematical models; 75\% felt that the level of mathematics was "too low" in their ecology classes; 90\% wanted more mathematics classes for ecologists; and 95\% more statistics classes. Respondents thought that 30\% of classes in ecology-related degrees should be focused on quantitative disciplines, which is likely higher than for most existing programs. The main suggestion to improve quantitative training was to relate theoretical and statistical modeling to applied ecological problems. Improving quantitative training will require dedicated, quantitative classes for ecology-related degrees that contain good mathematical and statistical practice.},

  abstract = {In the coming decades and centuries, the ocean's biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems will become increasingly stressed by at least three independent factors. Rising temperatures, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation will cause substantial changes in the physical, chemical and biological environment, which will then affect the ocean's biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems in ways that we are only beginning to fathom. Ocean warming will not only affect organisms and biogeochemical cycles directly, but will also increase upper ocean stratification. The changes in the ocean's carbonate chemistry induced by the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) (i.e. ocean acidification) will probably affect many organisms and processes, although in ways that are currently not well understood. Ocean deoxygenation, i.e. the loss of dissolved oxygen (O2) from the ocean, is bound to occur in a warming and more stratified ocean, causing stress to macro-organisms that critically depend on sufficient levels of oxygen. These three stressors\textemdash{}warming, acidification and deoxygenation\textemdash{}will tend to operate globally, although with distinct regional differences. The impacts of ocean acidification tend to be strongest in the high latitudes, whereas the low-oxygen regions of the low latitudes are most vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation. Specific regions, such as the eastern boundary upwelling systems, will be strongly affected by all three stressors, making them potential hotspots for change. Of additional concern are synergistic effects, such as ocean acidification-induced changes in the type and magnitude of the organic matter exported to the ocean's interior, which then might cause substantial changes in the oxygen concentration there. Ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation are essentially irreversible on centennial time scales, i.e. once these changes have occurred, it will take centuries for the ocean to recover. With the emission of CO2 being the primary driver behind all three stressors, the primary mitigation strategy is to reduce these emissions.},

The mean level of biomass observed over the whole body-size-range reflects the energy levels in particular ecosystems, while the succession of domes within the biomass spectrum expresses the trophic organization. Different shapes of these domes in different ecosystems may reflect the specific character of the predator-prey interactions in them.},

Where these spectra are recognized as dependent on predator-prey energy transfers, it is shown that solutions of the models consist of a smoothly varying or linear part plus a neglected but not negligible part that is periodic in the logarithm of body weight. The models can also be interpreted as yielding multiple spectra, in which the spectrum for a given trophic position is replicated at regular intervals over the range of body weight. In either interpretation the models support empirical data exhibiting significant quasi-periodic departures from a smoothly varying or straight line, without implying a priori knowledge of underlying mechanisms.

  abstract = {Ocean warming can modify the ecophysiology and distribution of marine organisms, and relationships between species, with nonlinear interactions between ecosystem components potentially resulting in trophic amplification. Trophic amplification (or attenuation) describe the propagation of a hydroclimatic signal up the food web, causing magnification (or depression) of biomass values along one or more trophic pathways. We have employed 3-D coupled physical-biogeochemical models to explore ecosystem responses to climate change with a focus on trophic amplification. The response of phytoplankton and zooplankton to global climate-change projections, carried out with the IPSL Earth System Model by the end of the century, is analysed at global and regional basis, including European seas (NE Atlantic, Barents Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Bay of Biscay, Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea) and the Eastern Boundary Upwelling System (Benguela). Results indicate that globally and in Atlantic Margin and North Sea, increased ocean stratification causes primary production and zooplankton biomass to decrease in response to a warming climate, whilst in the Barents, Baltic and Black Seas, primary production and zooplankton biomass increase. Projected warming characterized by an increase in sea surface temperature of 2.29~{$\pm{}~$}0.05~\textdegree{}C leads to a reduction in zooplankton and phytoplankton biomasses of 11\% and 6\%, respectively. This suggests negative amplification of climate driven modifications of trophic level biomass through bottom-up control, leading to a reduced capacity of oceans to regulate climate through the biological carbon pump. Simulations suggest negative amplification is the dominant response across 47\% of the ocean surface and prevails in the tropical oceans; whilst positive trophic amplification prevails in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans. Trophic attenuation is projected in temperate seas. Uncertainties in ocean plankton projections, associated to the use of single global and regional models, imply the need for caution when extending these considerations into higher trophic levels.},

  abstract = {Using empirical data from 466 temperate to arctic lakes covering a total phosphorus (TP) gradient of \$2-1036\textbackslash{} \textbackslash{}mu \{\textbackslash{}rm g\}\textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash{}rm L\}\^\{-1\}\$ , we describe how the relative contributions of resource supply, and predator control change along a nutrient gradient. We argue that (a) predator control on large-bodied zooplankton is unimodally related to TP and is highest in the most nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor lakes and generally higher in shallow than deep lakes, (b) the cascading effect of changes in predator control on phytoplankton decreases with increasing TP, and (c) these general patterns occur with significant variations-that is, the predation pressure can be low or high at all nutrient levels. A quantile regression revealed that the median share of the predator-sensitive Daphnia to the total cladoceran biomass was significantly related unimodally to TP, while the 10\% and 90\% percentiles approached 0 and 100\%, respectively, at all TP levels. Moreover, deep lakes (more than 6 m) had a higher percentage of Daphnia than shallow (less than 6 m) lakes. The median percentage of Daphnia peaked at \$0.15\textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash{}rm mg\}\textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash{}rm L\}\^\{-1\}\$ in shallow lakes and \$0.09\textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash{}rm mg\}\textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash{}rm L\}\^\{-1\}\$ in deep lakes. The assumption that fish are responsible for the unimodality was supported by data on the abundance of potential planktivorous fish ( \$\textbackslash{}text\{catch net\}\^\{-1\}\textbackslash{} \textbackslash{}text\{night\}\^\{-1\}\$ gill nets with the different mesh sizes [CPUE]). To elucidate the potential cascading effect on phytoplankton, we examined the zooplankton phytoplankton biomass ratio. Even though this ratio was inversely related to CPUE at all TP levels, we found an overall higher ratio in oligotrophic lakes that declined toward low values (typically below 0.2) in hypertrophic lakes. These results suggest that planktivorous fish have a more limited effect on the grazing control of phytoplankton in oligotrophic lakes than in eutrophic lakes, despite similar predator control of large-bodied zooplankton. Accordingly, the phytoplankton yield, expressed as the chlorophyll a-TP ratio, did not relate to CPUE at low TP, but it increased significantly with CPUE at high TP. We conclude that the chances of implementing a successful restoration program using biomanipulation as a tool to reduce phytoplankton biomass increase progressively with increasing TP, but that success in the long term is most likely achieved at intermediate TP concentrations.},

  abstract = {We develop a systematic analytic approach to the problem of branching and annihilating random walks, equivalent to the diffusion-limited reaction processes 2A \textrightarrow {$\varnothing$} and A \textrightarrow (m + 1) A, where m {$\geq$} 1. Starting from the master equation, a field-theoretic representation of the problem is derived, and fluctuation effects are taken into account via diagrammatic and renormalization group methods. For d {$>$} 2, the mean-field rate equation, which predicts an active phase as soon as the branching process is switched on, applies qualitatively for both even and odd m, but the behavior in lower dimensions is shown to be quite different for these two cases. For even m, and d near 2, the active phase still appears immediately, but with nontrivial crossover exponents which we compute in an expansion in {$\in$} = 2 - d, and with logarithmic corrections in d = 2. However, there exists a second critical dimension d{${'}$}c {$\approx$} 4/3 below which a nontrivial inactive phase emerges, with asymptotic behavior characteristic of the pure annihilation process. This is confirmed by an exact calculation in d = 1. The subsequent transition to the active phase, which represents a new nontrivial dynamic universality class, is then investigated within a truncated loop expansion, which appears to give a correct qualitative picture. The model with m = 2 is also generalized to N species of particles, which provides yet another universality class and which is exactly solvable in the limit N \textrightarrow {$\infty$}. For odd m, we show that the fluctuations of the annihilation process are strong enough to create a nontrivial inactive phase for all d {$\leq$} 2. In this case, the transition to the active phase is in the directed percolation universality class. Finally, we study the modification when the annihilation reaction is 3A \textrightarrow {$\varnothing$}. When m = 0 (mod 3) the system is always in its active phase, but with logarithmic crossover corrections for d = 1, while the other cases should exhibit a directed percolation transition out of a fluctuation-driven inactive phase.},

During a seasonal cycle, three main functional size ranges determined the allocation of the spectra irregularities: microbial food web, nanoplankton¬ñmicroplankton autotrophs, and herbivorous organisms. The structural adjustments within these trophic positions responded to the internal competition between functional guilds, mainly as the result of size-based characteristics related to the ability to eat and the susceptibility to be eaten. Despite the existence of a typical spectrum undulation resulting from self-organization (well-defined trophic positions, limnetic¬ñbenthic interaction), the biomass irregularities were an indicator of the main interactions disturbing the steady state.

The overall, time-integrated biomass spectrum shows a slope very close to zero. In addition, the presence of a discontinuity within the size range and the clear tendencies in the distribution of the residuals make the definition of an allometnc model on this scale difficult. At the smaller scale of subgroups (pico-, nano-, micro- and mesoplankton) there is a clear increase of biomass per unit water volume with body size. Our results suggest that, at least in this small ecosystem, the ecological and evolutionary relationships which operate at the secondary scale are more important in structuring the community than the physiological factors (size-dependent metabolism) which determine the primary scaling.},

  abstract = {To test existing hypotheses about the plankton size distribution (PSD) in lakes, we intensively sampled the plankton of a eutrophic, stratified lake (Arendsee) and constructed size spectra for particles ranging in size from bacteria to herbivorous cladocerans. The Arendsee Lake annual mean spectrum extended over nearly 10 decades of body size and 2.1 decades of biomass per size class (minimum, autotrophic picoplankton; maximum, colonial cyanobacteria). The spectrum was continuous (no size class without associated biomass). These data indicate that continuous PSDs are not restricted to the plankton in large pelagic zones (e.g., central oceanic systems or large freshwater lakes). We conclude that differences in the biomass of the various size classes are a consequence of eutrophic conditions in Arendsee Lake, not of littoral or benthic influences. In addition, we evaluated the impact of daphnids on the shape of the PSD with a data set comprising single samples from each of 28 lakes in northern Germany plus seasonal data from Arendsee Lake. In lakes or situations with a large Daphnia biomass ({$\geq$}0.5 mg fresh weight liter-1), the slopes of the straight lines fitted to the normalized PSDs were less negative. In the 28 northern lakes, but not in Arendsee Lake, there was greater variation about the fitted line when Daphnia biomass was high, indicating a less homogenous PSD. Discontinuities in the spectra were found only in samples from the 28 northern lakes and for higher Daphnia biomass. Our interpretation is that the feeding mode of large filter-feeders results in a higher transfer efficiency from small to larger individuals (less negative slopes), which produces  changes to a nonhomogenous PSD.},

By using empirical data of a cannibalistic fish population covering a 10-year period and a size-structured population model, we show the occurrence of a dynamic trophic cascade in a lake ecosystem, in which the community over time alternates between two different configurations. The intrinsically driven change in the size structure of the fish population from a dominance of stunted individuals to a dominance of gigantic cannibals among adult individuals is the driving force behind distinct abundance switches observed in zooplankton and phytoplankton. The presence of the phase with gigantic cannibals depends critically on the energy they extract from their victims, allowing strong reproduction for a number of years.},

  abstract = {Our goal is to find a macroscopic description of patterns that both unifies and simplifies classes of externally stressed, dissipative, pattern forming systems, such as convecting fluids, liquid crystals, wideband lasers, that are seemingly unrelated at the microscopic level. We construct an order parameter equation which provides a controlled approximation of the original microscopic field in the limit of large aspect ratios. It is built from, and is a regularization of, the Cross-Newell phase diffusion equation obtained by averaging over the local periodicity of the pattern. Unlike the latter, it is valid for all wavenumbers and can correctly capture the nucleation, shape and nontrivial properties of the far fields of disclinations, dislocations and grain boundaries. It reduces to the Cross-Newell equation away from pattern singularities and to the Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation near onset. As a consequence, it correctly determines all the long wave instability boundaries (zig-zag, Eckhaus-skew-varicose) of the Busse balloon. Far from onset, the order parameter is a real variable but its equation involves a functional corresponding to its local amplitude. The local amplitude and phase, required for the order parameter equation and the reconstruction of the approximation to the original field respectively, are extracted from the order parameter field by wavelet analysis. Numerical comparisons between solutions of the original equation and the regularized equation are carried out. We also explore a new class of singular and weak solutions of the Cross-Newell equation which take account of the energetics of defects as well as their topologies. These solutions correspond to convex and concave disclinations and their composites, including saddles, vortices, targets, dislocations and two new objects, handles and bridges. Finally, we show that phase grain boundaries, lines across which the wavevector is discontinuous but the phase is continuous are captured by shock solutions of the phase diffusion equation.},

The population is assumed to be confined in a refuge beyond which conditions are so harsh that they lead to certain extinction. Standard continuum mean field models in one dimension yield a critical refuge length Lc such that a population in a refuge larger than this is assured survival. Herein we extend the model to take into account the discreteness and finiteness of the population, which leads us to a stochastic description. We present a particular critical criterion for likely extinction, namely, that the standard deviation of the population be equal to the mean. According to this criterion, we find that while survival can no longer be guaranteed for any refuge size, for sufficiently weak competition one can make the refuge large enough (certainly larger than Lc) to cause extinction to be unlikely. However, beyond a certain value of the competition rate parameter it is no longer possible to escape a likelihood of extinction even in an infinite refuge. These unavoidable fluctuations therefore have a severe impact on refuge design issues.},

For example, in Europe, targets for (i) biodiversity, (ii) food web structure as indicated by the proportion of large fish and (iii) fishing mortality rates for exploited species that lead to maximum sustainable yield, FMSY, are being proposed to support implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Efforts to reconcile any trade-offs among objectives need to be informed by knowledge on the consequences of alternate management actions.

* We develop, calibrate and apply a multispecies size spectrum model of the North Sea fish community to assess the response of populations and the community to fishing. The model predicts species' size distributions, abundance, productivity and interactions and therefore provides a single framework for evaluating trade-offs between population status, community and food web structure, biodiversity and fisheries yield.

* We show that the model can replicate realistic fish population and community structure and past responses to fishing. We assess whether meeting management targets for exploited North Sea populations (fishing species at FMSY) will be sufficient to meet proposed targets for biodiversity and food web indicators under two management scenarios (status quo and FMSY).

* The recovery in biodiversity indicators is 60\% greater when fishing populations at FMSY than if status quo (2010) fishing rates are maintained. The probability of achieving a food web target was 60\% under both scenarios in spite of major community restructuring revealed by other indicators of community size structure.

* Synthesis and applications. Our model can be applied to evaluate indicator targets and trade-offs among fisheries and conservation objectives. There is a significant probability that reductions in fishing mortality below FMSY would be needed in Europe if managers make a binding commitment to a proposed large fish indicator target, with concomitant reductions in fisheries yield.},

  volume = {8},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Zooplankton are relatively small in size in the subtropical regions. This characteristic has been attributed to intense predation pressure, high nutrient loading and cyanobacterial biomass. To provide further information on the effect of predation and cyanobacteria on zooplankton size structure, we analyzed data from 96 shallow aquaculture lakes along the Yangtze River. Contrary to former studies, both principal components analysis and multiple regression analysis showed that the mean zooplankton size was positively related to fish yield. The studied lakes were grouped into three types, namely, natural fishing lakes with low nutrient loading (Type1), planktivorous fish-dominated lakes (Type 2), and eutrophic lakes with high cyanobacterial biomass (Type 3). A marked difference in zooplankton size structure was found among these groups. The greatest mean zooplankton size was observed in Type 2 lakes, but zooplankton density was the lowest. Zooplankton abundance was highest in Type 3 lakes and increased with increasing cyanobacterial biomass. Zooplankton mean size was negatively correlated with cyanobacterial biomass. No obvious trends were found in Type 1 lakes. These results were reflected by the normalized biomass size spectrum, which showed a unimodal shape with a peak at medium sizes in Type 2 lakes and a peak at small sizes in Type 3 lakes. These results indicated a relative increase in medium-sized and small-sized species in Types 2 and 3 lakes, respectively. Our results suggested that fish predation might have a negative effect on zooplankton abundance but a positive effect on zooplankton size structure. High cyanobacterial biomass most likely caused a decline in the zooplankton size and encouraged the proliferation of small zooplankton. We suggest that both planktivorous fish and cyanobacteria have substantial effects on the shaping of zooplankton community, particularly in the lakes in the eastern plain along the Yangtze River where aquaculture is widespread and nutrient loading is high.},

Abstract
Ocean acidification is a pervasive stressor that could affect many marine organisms and cause profound ecological shifts. A variety of biological responses to ocean acidification have been measured across a range of taxa, but this information exists as case studies and has not been synthesized into meaningful comparisons amongst response variables and functional groups. We used meta-analytic techniques to explore the biological responses to ocean acidification, and found negative effects on survival, calcification, growth and reproduction. However, there was significant variation in the sensitivity of marine organisms. Calcifying organisms generally exhibited larger negative responses than non-calcifying organisms across numerous response variables, with the exception of crustaceans, which calcify but were not negatively affected. Calcification responses varied significantly amongst organisms using different mineral forms of calcium carbonate. Organisms using one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate (high-magnesium calcite) can be more resilient to ocean acidification than less soluble forms (calcite and aragonite). Additionally, there was variation in the sensitivities of different developmental stages, but this variation was dependent on the taxonomic group. Our analyses suggest that the biological effects of ocean acidification are generally large and negative, but the variation in sensitivity amongst organisms has important implications for ecosystem responses.},

  abstract = {Public concern over biodiversity loss is often rationalized as a threat to ecosystem functioning, but biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relations are hard to empirically quantify at large scales. We use a realistic marine food-web model, resolving species over five trophic levels, to study how total fish production changes with species richness. This complex model predicts that BEF relations, on average, follow simple Michaelis\textendash{}Menten curves when species are randomly deleted. These are shaped mainly by release of fish from predation, rather than the release from competition expected from simpler communities. Ordering species deletions by decreasing body mass or trophic level, representing `fishing down the food web', accentuates prey-release effects and results in unimodal relationships. In contrast, simultaneous unselective harvesting diminishes these effects and produces an almost linear BEF relation, with maximum multispecies fisheries yield at {$\approx$}40\% of initial species richness. These findings have important implications for the valuation of marine biodiversity.

  abstract = {Plants can have positive effects on each other. For example, the accumulation of nutrients, provision of shade, amelioration of disturbance, or protection from herbivores by some species can enhance the performance of neighbouring species. Thus the notion that the distributions and abundances of plant species are independent of other species may be inadequate as a theoretical underpinning for understanding species coexistence and diversity. But there have been no large-scale experiments designed to examine the generality of positive interactions in plant communities and their importance relative to competition. Here we show that the biomass, growth and reproduction of alpine plant species are higher when other plants are nearby. In an experiment conducted in subalpine and alpine plant communities with 115 species in 11 different mountain ranges, we find that competition generally, but not exclusively, dominates interactions at lower elevations where conditions are less physically stressful. In contrast, at high elevations where abiotic stress is high the interactions among plants are predominantly positive. Furthermore, across all high and low sites positive interactions are more important at sites with low temperatures in the early summer, but competition prevails at warmer sites.},

  abstract = {Summary
Microbial cells secrete numerous enzymes, scavenging molecules, and signals that can promote the growth and survival of other cells around them [1\textendash{}4]. This observation is consistent with the evolution of cooperation within species [5], and there is now an increasing emphasis on the importance of cooperation between different microbial species [4, 6]. We lack, however, a systematic test of the importance of mutually positive interactions between different species, which is vital for assessing the commonness and importance of cooperative evolution in natural communities. Here, we study the extent of mutually positive interaction among bacterial strains isolated from a common aquatic environment. Using data collected from two independent experiments evaluating community productivity across diversity gradients, we show that (1) in pairwise species combinations, the great majority of interactions are net negative and (2) there is no evidence that strong higher-order positive effects arise when more than two species are mixed together. Our data do not exclude the possibility of positive effects in one direction where one species gains at the expense of another, i.e., predator-prey-like interactions. However, these do not constitute cooperation and our analysis suggests that the typical result of adaptation to other microbial species will be competitive, rather than cooperative, phenotypes.},

  abstract = {* Natural communities commonly contain many different species and functional groups, and multiple types of species interactions act simultaneously, such as competition, predation, commensalism or mutualism. However, experimental and theoretical investigations have generally been limited by focusing on one type of interaction at a time or by a lack of a common methodological and conceptual approach to measure species interactions.

* We compared four methods to measure and express species interactions. These approaches are, with increasing degree of model complexity, an extinction-based model, a relative yield model and two generalized Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. All four approaches have been individually applied in different fields of community ecology, but rarely integrated. We provide an overview of the definitions, assumptions and data needed for the specific methods and apply them to empirical data by experimentally deriving the interaction matrices among 11 protist and rotifer species, belonging to three functional groups. Furthermore, we compare their advantages and limitations to predict multispecies community dynamics and ecosystem functioning.

* The relative yield method is, in terms of final biomass production, the best method in predicting the 11-species community dynamics from the pairwise competition experiments. The LV model, which is considering equilibrium among the species, suffers from experimental constraints given the strict equilibrium assumption, and this may be rarely satisfied in ecological communities.

* We show how simulations of a LV stochastic community model, derived from an empirical interaction matrix, can be used to predict multispecies community dynamics across multiple functional groups.

* Our work unites available tools to measure species interactions under one framework. This improves our ability to make management-oriented predictions of species coexistence/extinction and to compare ecosystem processes across study systems.},

These functional groups represent the nodes of ecological networks. Direct and indirect interactions among them were assessed using partial Mantel tests. Interaction web complexity was quantified using three measures of network structure: connectance, interaction diversity and interaction strength. 3.\hspace{0.6em}Compared with high plant diversity plots, interaction webs based on low plant diversity plots showed reduced complexity in terms of total connectance, interaction diversity and mean interaction strength. Plant diversity effects obviously cascade up the food web and modify interactions across all trophic levels. The strongest effects occurred in interactions between adjacent trophic levels (i.e. predominantly trophic interactions), while significant interactions among plant and carnivore functional groups, as well as horizontal interactions (i.e. interactions between functional groups of the same trophic level), showed rather inconsistent responses and were generally rarer. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Reduced interaction diversity has the potential to decrease and destabilize ecosystem processes. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of basal producer species leads to more simple structured, less and more loosely connected species assemblages, which in turn are very likely to decrease ecosystem functioning, community robustness and tolerance to disturbance. Our results suggest that the functioning of the entire ecological community is critically linked to the diversity of its component plants species.},

  volume = {465},

  abstract = {Foundation species, such as oysters, corals, and seagrasses, form the basis for entire ecosystems and are characterized by positive interactions with community members. However, many species interactions are context dependent, where the outcome or strength of the interaction depends on the biotic or abiotic conditions. Therefore, a mechanistic knowledge of species interactions, especially those involving foundation species, may allow for a more complete understanding of how anthropogenic changes influence nearshore ecosystems. This study describes the interaction between the seagrass Thalassia testudinum and the sponge Halichondria melanadocia, a species that grows around the base of seagrass shoots. A combination of surveys and experimental manipulations on Abaco Island, The Bahamas, revealed that the interaction between T. testudinum and H. melanadocia is a commensal relationship with the sponge benefiting from the presence of T. testudinum up to medium shoot densities (589-615 shoots per m(2)). The net neutral effect of H. melanadocia on T. testudinum is likely a balance of the negative effect of the sponge shading the seagrass with the positive effect of nitrogen and phosphorus supplied by the sponge. The mechanisms underlying the interaction between H. melanadocia and T. testudinum suggest that the interaction is likely context dependent. As such, environmental change, namely eutrophication, has the potential to shift the nature of this interaction from commensal to parasitic. A simple simulation showed that if this relationship becomes parasitic, above ground production in seagrass beds could be reduced.

  abstract = {Background: Studies on plant-plant interactions in alpine ecosystems show a strong bias for temperate vs. tropical latitudes and pay limited attention to the implications of biophysical heterogeneity beyond the local plant scale. Aims: To evaluate the effects of a dominant shrub (Hypericum laricifolium) on community organisation, integrating multiple scales of analysis, in a high Andean paramo in Venezuela. Methods: We compared plant cover, species richness and Shannon diversity between plots placed under the shrub and outside (plant scale); quantified the spatial relations of Hypericum with its conspecifics, heterospecifics and rocks at different radial distances, using covariance functions (patch scale); analysed the effects of Hypericum shrubs on total species richness in the community (site scale); and evaluated the consistency of our results among four sites within the same region (between-site scale). Results: Average species richness, Shannon diversity, and the abundance of common forbs and conspecific shrubs were consistently higher inside the Hypericum shrub, while the exotic Rumex acetosella was more abundant in open areas. However, the aggregated spatial distribution of conspecifics and other species extended beyond the local plant scale and there were no clear effects of Hypericum shrubs on community-level species richness. Conclusions: Shrubs can function as foundation species in tropical alpine environments, modifying local community structure and alpha diversity, but not necessarily the species richness of the overall community. Our results stress the need of analysing multiple spatial scales to interpret the role of plant-plant interactions (facilitation/competition) in heterogeneous alpine ecosystems.},

This criticism, however, is not widely shared nor fully supported by empirical data. We addressed whether changes in interaction intensity in plots under severe environmental stress determine an increase in facilitation and whether facilitation would expand the realized niche of some plant species. LocationFour sites differing in elevation and environmental conditions along a N-S transect in the Central Tibetan Plateau, Qinghai Province, China. MethodsWe assessed plant interaction intensity between the cushion plant, Androsace tapete, and species growing inside its canopy. We recorded species and number of individuals in cushions and in gaps, and mass of the two most frequent species in each site. ResultsInteractions ranged from competition to facilitation, depending on environmental severity. Net interaction balance followed predictions of the SGH, from competition on the relatively more mesic sites to facilitation in the relatively more stressful sites. There were no hints of facilitation collapse even though our harsher sites posed extreme conditions for plant survival. The main limiting factor seems to be temperature, as interaction intensity responded most to this factor, rather than to elevation or rainfall. ConclusionsFacilitation expanded the realized niche of some species, countering adverse environmental conditions. We found no collapse of facilitation under the most stressful conditions, even though some sites were at the edge of the distribution range for the cushion species.},

Such foundation tree species are declining throughout the world due to introductions and outbreaks of pests and pathogens, selective removal of individual taxa, and over-harvesting. Through a series of case studies, we show that the loss of foundation tree species changes the local environment on which a variety of other species depend; how this disrupts fundamental ecosystem processes, including rates of decomposition, nutrient fluxes, carbon sequestration, and energy flow; and dramatically alters the dynamics of associated aquatic ecosystems. Forests in which dynamics are controlled by one or a few foundation species appear to be dominated by a small number of strong interactions and may be highly susceptible to alternating between stable states following even small perturbations. The ongoing decline of many foundation species provides a set of important, albeit unfortunate, opportunities to develop the research tools, models, and metrics needed to identify foundation species, anticipate the cascade of immediate, short- and long-term changes in ecosystem structure and function that will follow from their loss, and provide options for remedial conservation and management.},

Global warming is linked to a widespread decline in body size, whereas increased flood frequency can amplify nutrient enrichment through enhanced run-off. Altered population body-size structure represents a disruption in top-down control, whereas eutrophication embodies a change in bottom-up forcing. These processes are typically studied in isolation and little is known about their potential interactive effects. Here, we present the results of an in situ experiment examining the combined effects of top-down and bottom-up forces on the structure of a coastal marine community. Reduced average body mass of the top predator (the shore crab, Carcinus maenas) and nutrient enrichment combined additively to alter mean community body mass. Nutrient enrichment increased species richness and overall density of organisms. Reduced top-predator body mass increased community biomass. Additionally, we found evidence for an allometrically induced trophic cascade. Here, the reduction in top-predator body mass enabled greater biomass of intermediate fish predators within the mesocosms. This, in turn, suppressed key micrograzers, which led to an overall increase in microalgal biomass. This response highlights the possibility for climate-induced trophic cascades, driven by altered size structure of populations, rather than species extinction.},

  abstract = {To select candidate populations of wild species to be given priority for conservation, genetic criteria gained from the study of molecular markers may be useful. Traditionally, diversity measures such as expected heterozygosity or percentage of polymorphic loci have been considered. For conservation we propose instead that priority should be given to measures of allelic richness. To standardize the results of allelic richnexx across populations, we used the technique of rarefaction. This technique allows evaluation of the expected number of different alleles among equal-sized samples drawn from several different populations. We also show how the contribution of each population to total diversity can be partitioned into two components. The first is related to the level of diversity of the population and the second to its divergence from the other populations. For conservation purposes the uniqueness of a population-in terms of its allelic composition-may be at least as important as its diveristy level. These new descriptors are illustrated by means of isozyme and chloroplast DNA data obtained for an endangered tree species, the argan tree of Morocco (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels). With these analysis the conservation value of the argan tree populations, especially those of two isolated present in the broth of the country, can be better appreciated. The methods proposed to identify priority areas for conservation of the genetic resources of the argan tree are compared to those sometimes advocated in the case of reserve design, where one of the goals is to maximize-species richness.},

Here I review the evidence on the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk. Inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity and mutation accumulation have been hypothesised to increase extinction risk. There is now compelling evidence that inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity increase extinction risk in laboratory populations of naturally outbreeding species. There is now clear evidence for inbreeding depression in wild species of naturally outbreeding species and strong grounds from individual case studies and from computer projections for believing that this contributes to extinction risk. Further, most species are not driven to extinction before genetic factors have time to impact. The contributions of mutation accumulation to extinction risk in threatened taxa appear to be small and to require very many generations. Thus, there is now sufficient evidence to regard the controversies regarding the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk as resolved. If genetic factors are ignored, extinction risk will be underestimated and inappropriate recovery strategies may be used.},

  abstract = {Estimating actual and potential areas of distribution of species via ecological niche modeling has become a very active field of research, yet important conceptual issues in this field remain confused. We argue that conceptual clarity is enhanced by adopting restricted definitions of ``niche'' that enable operational definitions of basic concepts like fundamental, potential, and realized niches and potential and actual distributional areas. We apply these definitions to the question of niche conservatism, addressing what it is that is conserved and showing with a quantitative example how niche change can be measured. In this example, we display the extremely irregular structure of niche space, arguing that it is an important factor in understanding niche evolution. Many cases of apparently successful models of distributions ignore biotic factors: we suggest explanations to account for this paradox. Finally, relating the probability of observing a species to ecological factors, we address the issue of what objects are actually calculated by different niche modeling algorithms and stress the fact that methods that use only presence data calculate very different quantities than methods that use absence data. We conclude that the results of niche modeling exercises can be interpreted much better if the ecological and mathematical assumptions of the modeling process are made explicit.},

Mortality rate and average daily water temperature were positively correlated (P = 0.018). Juveniles' mortality rate and allelic richness estimated from ten microsatellite loci were negatively correlated (P = 0.046). Together, an overdominance of heterozygotes was observed within hostile environments. These results suggest that an allelic richness loss may be expected as a direct consequence of unfavorable environmental conditions.

  volume = {333},
  issn = {0022-0981},
  abstract = {The life histories of oysters in the genus Crassostrea, like those of most marine bivalves, are typified by high fecundity and low survival in nature. Rearing conditions in hatcheries however ensure optimized density, diet, and temperature. Hatcheries are becoming increasingly important for the production of juveniles in aquaculture, and their culture practices often include culling of slow growing larvae to reduce and synchronize the time taken to reach settlement. Because previous studies have found substantial genetic variation for early life developmental traits in Crassostrea gigas, these culling practices are likely to cause highly different selective pressures in hatcheries from those in the natural environment. We studied the phenotypic and genetic impact of such culling practices in a factorial cross between 10 males and 3 females subjected to progressive culling of the smallest 50\% of larvae, compared with a non-culled control. Measurements were made on larval growth, survival, time taken to attain pediveliger stage and settlement success. Culling had a larger effect on the variance of these larval traits than on their means. The larvae in culled cultures were approximately 10\% larger than those in controls, whereas the coefficient of variation was reduced by 30\textendash{}40\%. Culling also reduced the mean time to settlement by 12\% and its variance by 55\%. Using a multiplexed set of microsatellite markers to trace parentage, we also estimated the variance in reproductive success in a controlled experiment to quantify the consequences of intensive hatchery rearing practices. We also focused on changes in effective population size and genetic structure over time (and developmental stages). Our results show a loss of genetic diversity following removal of the smallest larvae by culling, as well as temporally varying genetic structure of the larval population. This supports the existence of genetic variability in early life developmental traits in C. gigas. Culling in hatcheries, like size-related selective pressures in the wild, are likely to have a significant genetic impact, through their effects on the timing of settlement.},

Both these quantities are supposed to indicate the amount of genetic variability for plasticity in a natural population. I point out that not only are the qualitative predictions based on these statistical methods sometimes in conflict with each other, but that both may fail to predict rates of evolution and equilibria under some circumstances, because they ignore the details of the genetic machinery. It is shown that, ultimately, the only way to predict reliably the evolution of plasticity is actually to know its specific genetic basis and the genotypic constitution of the population, however inconvenient this may be from both theoretical and empirical standpoints. The discussion is framed in terms of a simple one-locus two-allele model that mimics the real case of the pennant/vestigial system describing plasticity of wing length to temperature in Drosophila melanogaster.},

This deterministic model has been evaluated by measuring the fraction of trophic relations it correctly predicts. I contrasted this value with that produced by simpler models based on body sizes and found that the quantitative information on allometric scaling and optimal foraging does not significantly increase model fit. Also, I present a method to compute the p-value for the fraction of trophic interactions correctly predicted by the ADBM, or any other model, with respect to three probabilistic models. I find that the ADBM predicts significantly more links than random graphs, but other models can outperform it. Although optimal foraging and allometric scaling may improve our understanding of food webs, the ADBM needs to be modified or replaced to find support in the data.},

Consequently, there is an increasing need for governments to address the role of international trade in their strategies to prevent species introductions. However, many of the most problematic alien species are not recent arrivals but were introduced several decades ago. Hence, current patterns of alien-species richness may better reflect historical rather than contemporary human activities, a phenomenon which might be called ``invasion debt.'' Here, we show that across 10 taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, fungi, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, terrestrial insects, and aquatic invertebrates) in 28 European countries, current numbers of alien species established in the wild are indeed more closely related to indicators of socioeconomic activity from the year 1900 than to those from 2000, although the majority of species introductions occurred during the second half of the 20th century. The strength of the historical signal varies among taxonomic groups, with those possessing good capabilities for dispersal (birds, insects) more strongly associated with recent socioeconomic drivers. Nevertheless, our results suggest a considerable historical legacy for the majority of the taxa analyzed. The consequences of the current high levels of socioeconomic activity on the extent of biological invasions will thus probably not be completely realized until several decades into the future.},

  abstract = {Marine legislation is becoming more complex and marine ecosystem-based management is specified in national and regional legislative frameworks. Shelf-seas community and ecosystem models (hereafter termed ecosystem models) are central to the delivery of ecosystem-based management, but there is limited uptake and use of model products by decision makers in Europe and the UK in comparison with other countries. In this study, the challenges to the uptake and use of ecosystem models in support of marine environmental management are assessed using the UK capability as an example. The UK has a broad capability in marine ecosystem modelling, with at least 14 different models that support management, but few examples exist of ecosystem modelling that underpin policy or management decisions. To improve understanding of policy and management issues that can be addressed using ecosystem models, a workshop was convened that brought together advisors, assessors, biologists, social scientists, economists, modellers, statisticians, policy makers, and funders. Some policy requirements were identified that can be addressed without further model development including: attribution of environmental change to underlying drivers, integration of models and observations to develop more efficient monitoring programmes, assessment of indicator performance for different management goals, and the costs and benefit of legislation. Multi-model ensembles are being developed in cases where many models exist, but model structures are very diverse making a standardised approach of combining outputs a significant challenge, and there is a need for new methodologies for describing, analysing, and visualising uncertainties. A stronger link to social and economic systems is needed to increase the range of policy-related questions that can be addressed. It is also important to improve communication between policy and modelling communities so that there is a shared understanding of the strengths and limitations of ecosystem models.},

Significant correlation is found between hypoxic area and both nitrogen load ( r 2 = 0.24) and east\textendash{}west wind speed ( r 2 = 0.16). There is also a significant increasing trend in the areal extent of hypoxia in time; a linearly increasing trend over the entire record ( r 2 = 0.17), a step increase in area for the years 1994 and beyond ( r 2 = 0.21), and a step increase for 1993 and beyond ( r 2 = 0.29) were all found to be significantly correlated with area. The year 1988, often included in other studies, was found to be a statistical outlier, in that the statistical regression properties are strongly modified when this year is included. The exclusion of any other year does not have as great an effect as excluding 1988 from the record. The year 1989 is also excluded, as this year had no full shelf survey, for a total of 24 years of data for the record. Multivariable regression models using all possible combinations of the forcing variables considered were calculated. The best performing models included east\textendash{}west wind, either a linear trend in time or step in time (1994 and beyond), and either nitrogen load or river discharge combined with nitrogen concentration. The range of adjusted correlation coefficients ranged from r 2 = 0.47 to 0.67.

  abstract = {AbstractExplaining variation in species richness among provinces and other large geographic regions remains one of the most challenging problems at the intersection of ecology and evolution. Here we argue that empirical evidence supports a model whereby ecological factors associated with resource availability regulate species richness at continental scales. Any large-scale predictive model for biological diversity must explain three robust patterns in the natural world. First, species richness for evolutionary biotas is highly correlated with resource-associated surrogate variables, including area, temperature, and productivity. Second, species richness across epochal timescales is largely stationary in time. Third, the dynamics of diversity exhibit clear and predictable responses to mass extinctions, key innovations, and other perturbations. Collectively, these patterns are readily explained by a model in which species richness is regulated by diversity-dependent feedback mechanisms. We argue that many purported tests of the ecological limits hypothesis, including branching patterns in molecular phylogenies, are inherently weak and distract from these three core patterns. We have much to learn about the complex hierarchy of processes by which local ecological interactions lead to diversity dependence at the continental scale, but the empirical evidence overwhelmingly suggests that they do.},

We used an outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment to investigate the interactive effects of warming, eutrophication, and changes in top predators on the flux of biomass between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We demonstrated that predatory fish decoupled aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by reducing the emergence of aquatic organisms and suppressing the decomposition of terrestrial plant detritus. In contrast, warming and nutrients enhanced cross-ecosystem exchanges by increasing emergence and decomposition, and these effects were strongest in the absence of predators. Furthermore, we found that warming advanced while predators delayed the phenology of insect emergence. Our results demonstrate that anthropogenic perturbations may extend well beyond ecosystem boundaries by influencing cross-ecosystem subsidies. We find that these changes are sufficient to substantially impact recipient communities and potentially alter the carbon balance between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {``Mass effects,'' in which ``sink populations'' of locally inferior competitors are maintained by dispersal from ``source populations'' elsewhere in the landscape, are thought to play an important role in maintaining plant diversity. However, due to the complexity of most quasi-realistic forest models, there is little theoretical understanding of the strength of mass effects in forests. Here, we develop a metacommunity version of a mathematically and computationally tractable height-structured forest model, the Perfect Plasticity Approximation, to quantify the strength of mass effects (i.e., the degree of mixing of locally dominant and subordinate species) in heterogeneous landscapes comprising different patch types (e.g., soil types). For realistic levels of inter-patch dispersal, mass effects are weak at equilibrium (i.e., in the absence of disturbance), even in some cases where differences in growth, mortality, and fecundity rates between locally dominant and subordinate species are too small to be reliably detected from field data. However, patch-scale transient dynamics are slow following catastrophic disturbance (in which post-disturbance initial abundances are determined exclusively by immigration) so that at any given time, subordinate species are present in appreciable numbers in most patches. Less severe disturbance regimes, in which some seeds or individuals survive the disturbance, should result in faster transient dynamics (i.e., faster approach to the low-diversity equilibrium). Our results suggest that in order for mass effects to play an important role in tree coexistence, niche differences must be strong enough to prevent neutral drift, yet too weak to be reliably detected from field data.},

Freshwater invertebrates achieve dispersal using a variety of mechanisms that can be broadly categorized as active or passive, and which have important consequences for processes of colonization, gene flow, and evolutionary divergence. Apart from flight in adult freshwater insects, active dispersal appears relatively uncommon. Passive dispersal may occur through transport by animal vectors or wind, often involving a specific desiccation-resistant stage in the life cycle. Dispersal in freshwater taxa is difficult to study directly, and rare but biologically significant dispersal events may remain undetected. Increased use of molecular markers has provided considerable insight into the frequency of dispersal in freshwater invertebrates, particularly for groups such as crustaceans and bryozoans that disperse passively through the transport of desiccation-resistant propagules. The establishment of propagule banks in sediment promotes dispersal in time and may be particularly important for passive dispersers by allowing temporal escape from unfavorable conditions. Patterns that apply to dispersal in freshwater invertebrates can be readily extended to other fresh-water taxa, since common challenges arise from the colonization of isolated aquatic systems.},

The tested indicators include the slope of the biomass spectrum, the mean trophic level (MTL), the marine trophic index (MTI) and two newly developed indicators, the high trophic level indicator (HTI) and the apex predator indicator (API). Indicators are compared between current state and potential reference situations, using as case studies: the Celtic Sea/Bay of Biscay, North Sea and English Channel ecosystems. Trophic spectra are obtained from Ecopath models while reference situations are estimated, simulating with EcoTroph and Ecosim different fishing pressures including three candidate scenarios for an EAFM. Inter-ecosystems assessments are done using Ecopath models, simulations outputs and scientific surveys data to assess the current states of the studied ecosystems, contrast the reference situations and analyze the responses of all indicators. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted on the main simulation parameters to test the robustness of the chosen indicators. Ecosystems specific targets for EAFM are proposed for the five trophic indicators estimated from whole-ecosystem models, while in the Celtic Sea/Bay of Biscay ecosystem targets are proposed for the MTL (=3.85) and HTI (48\%) estimated from standard bottom-trawl surveys. The HTI is proposed to be relevant for survey data and the API is recommended using whole-ecosystem models. We conclude that HTI and API show trends in ecosystems health better than MTI.},

  abstract = {Increasing centralization of the control of fisheries combined with increased knowledge of food-web relationships is likely to lead to attempts to maximize economic yield from entire food webs. With the exception of predator\textendash{}prey systems, we lack any analysis of the nature of such yield-maximizing strategies. We use simple food-web models to investigate the nature of yield- or profit-maximizing exploitation of communities including two types of three-species food webs and a variety of six-species systems with as many as five trophic levels. These models show that, for most webs, relatively few species are harvested at equilibrium and that a significant fraction of the species is lost from the web. These extinctions occur for two reasons: (1) indirect effects due to harvesting of species that had positive effects on the extinct species, and (2) intentional eradication of species that are not themselves valuable, but have negative effects on more valuable species. In most cases, the yield-maximizing harvest involves taking only species from one trophic level. In no case was an unharvested top predator part of the yield-maximizing strategy. Analyses reveal that the existence of direct density dependence in consumers has a large effect on the nature of the optimal harvest policy, typically resulting in harvest of a larger number of species. A constraint that all species must be retained in the system (a ``constraint of biodiversity conservation'') usually increases the number of species and trophic levels harvested at the yield-maximizing policy. The reduction in total yield caused by such a constraint is modest for most food webs but can be over 90\% in some cases. Independent harvesting of species within the web can also cause extinctions but is less likely to do so.},

Ecosystem models can be used to quantify trade-offs and focus discussion around objectives. Given large structural uncertainties inherent in ecosystem models, however, comparative approaches are recommended to identify results that are robust to model formulation. We developed ecosystem models of the continental shelf and slope of New South Wales, Australia, using two ecosystem modelling frameworks, Atlantis and Ecopath with Ecosim. The models were calibrated to emulate large-scale changes in ecosystem structure between 1976 and 1996, as predicted by data from fishery-independent trawl surveys. Calibrated models were projected forward under a range of ``optimal'' fishing efforts designed to achieve economic, conservation or biodiversity objectives. While there were large differences in model predictions for individual species, the models gave very similar qualitative results when ranking fishing policies and describing trade-offs. Our results illustrate the importance of identifying fishery objectives before build-up of fleet capacity, and the need to consider trade-offs when simultaneously stating multiple ecosystem-level goals. Our finding that structurally-distinct ecosystem models can provide consistent qualitative advice highlights the capacity of ecosystem models for informing strategic management questions, even in the presence of considerable uncertainty in ecosystem-level processes.},

  abstract = {For a relationship of three-species competition similar to the game of rock\textendash{}scissors\textendash{}paper, which is an non-transitive competitive system in contrast to competitive hierarchies, we construct the Levins-like metapopulation model (LMM) based on the mean-field assumption and the probability transition model (PTM) based on Markov process and allowing random dispersal with different distance in homogenous patchy environment. LMM exhibits damped oscillation, periodic fluctuation and stage equilibrium dynamics determined by colonization and extinction rates of three species. The stage equilibrium dynamics is an interesting dynamical behavior not only because equilibrium state can transit with time but also the residential time at every equilibrium stage increases exponentially with stage transition. PTM with local dispersal indicates that the cyclic chasing of three species can form ripple-like patterns on space\textendash{}time plane and spray-like distribution on two-dimensional space. Such spatially self-organized structure can significantly stabilize metapopulation dynamics and promote species coexistence. However, dispersal distance profoundly affects the spatial structure and the behavior and stability of metapopulation dynamics. With the increase of dispersal distance, the spatial structure becomes blurry and even disappears lastly; and the intensity of metapopulation fluctuation enhances for some parameter values leading to unstable fluctuation in mean-field assumption. It implies that limited dispersal may be a stabilizing factor and play an important role in persisting biological diversity. In addition, indirect effect may be a particular property to non-transitive community. When the colonization rate for a given species increases, its own occupancy decreases contradictorily, but the occupancy of its superior competitor increases largely. Similarly, when extinction rate decreases, the occupancy of its superior species increases more rapidly than its own.},

  abstract = {Multi-species models consider interactions, particularly predation, between and within species. Traditional harvest management strategies, such as maximum sustainable yield do not account for these interactions. The exploitation of a single species can be maximised, but this does not mean that the entire ecosystem is being harvested sustainably or at its economic maximum. I present a computational technique (evolutionary algorithms) that can simultaneously optimise harvest management strategies of many species and can easily be modified to allow for factors such as stock recovery, sustainable yields or maximum levels of economic sustainable exploitation. I demonstrate that in an ecologically sustainably managed system where a stock is recovering, maximum economic yield is identical to the maximisation of yield by mass. These findings may have important implications for long term conservation aims and long term profits by fishers.},

  abstract = {Lakes and ponds are scattered on Earth's surface as islands in the ocean. The organisms inhabiting these ecosystems have thus developed strategies to pass the barrier represented by the surrounding land, to disperse and to colonize new environments. The evidences of a high potential for passive long-range dispersal of organisms producing resting stages inspired the idea that there were no real barriers to their actual dispersal, and that their distribution was only limited by the ecological characteristics of the available habitats. The development of genetic techniques allowed to criticize this view and revealed the existence of a more complex and diverse biological scenario governed by an assortment of historical and ecological factors. In this paper, we review the literature related to the passive dispersal of organisms producing resting stages among inland lentic ecosystems, with special emphasis to temporary ponds, which represent ``isolated'' ecosystems both in space and in time, and are characterized by high levels of biological diversity. The existence of a sharp decoupling between ``dispersal potential'' and ``actual establishment rates'' is stressed, thus urging a definitive overcome of the so-called ``Everything is Everywhere'' hypothesis in order to gain a proper understanding of the biogeography and ecology of inland water organisms.},

We show that application of MSY policy will lead to extinction of a large number of fish species in most ecosystems. More precisely, we show: approaching MSY in ecosystems means that most likely fish species will be driven to extinction in every fishery that includes exploitation of at least one trophic level which is directly or indirectly used as food for a higher trophic level. Because such single and multispecies fisheries make up a great majority of existing fisheries, attempts to reach MSY should be discouraged instead of being legally prescribed as a goal. Based on our result, we offer a simple prescription for managing a fishery in agreement with the Convention on Biological Diversity.},

In case of selective harvesting, when the effort is adjusted to each species, the optimum effort may result in the total maximum sustainable yield (TMSY1). When it exists, reaching TMSY1 does not affect the system stability character, but it does affect the state, and hence some populations may reach too small a value to persist in nature. If competition is strong, species with smaller biotic potential may be driven to extinction. In case the system is harvested with a common harvesting effort, such as in trawler fishery, the total maximum sustainable yield (TMSY2) is smaller than TMSY1, and all the species with lower or equal biotic potential to the optimum harvesting effort will be driven to extinction. In this case a call for implementation of the MSY is equivalent to a call for the extermination of some species and it runs directly against the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, 1992). Therefore, all legal documents advocating MSY in ecosystems starting with the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPI, 2002) must be urgently retracted and replaced with adaptive management which will respect CBD.},

  abstract = {"Switching" in predators which attack several prey species potentially can stabilize the numbers in prey populations. In switching, the number of attacks upon a species is disproportionately large when the species is abundant relative to other prey, and disproportionately small when the species is relatively rare. The null case for two prey species can be written: P1/P2 = cN1/N2, where P1/P2 is the ratio of the two prey expected in the diet, N1/N2 is the ratio given and c is a proportionality constant. Predators were sea\textemdash{}shore snails and prey were mussels and barnacles. Experiments in the laboratory modelled aspects of various natural situations. When the predator had a strong preference (c) between prey the data and the "null case" model were in good agreement. Preference could not altered by subjecting predators to training regimens. When preference was weak the data did not fit the model replicates were variable. Predators could be trained easily to one or other prey species. From a number of experiments it was concluded that in the weak\textemdash{}preference case no switch would occur in nature except where there is an opportunity for predators to become trained to the abundant species. A patchy distribution of the abundant prey could provide this opportunity. Given one prey species, snails caused a decreasing percentage mortality as prey numbers increased. This occurred also with 2 prey species present when preference was strong. When preference was weak the form of the response was unclear. When switching occurred the percentage prey mortality increased with prey density, giving potentially stabilizing mortality. The consequences of these conclusions for prey population regulation and for diversity are discussed.  See full-text article at JSTOR},

In the category of passive dispersers, large-bodied groups showed stronger spatial patterning than small-bodied groups suggesting an increasing impact of dispersal limitation with increasing body size. Metacommunities of organisms with the ability to fly (i.e. insect groups) showed a weaker imprint of dispersal limitation than passive dispersers with similar body size. In contrast, dispersal movements of vertebrate groups (fish and amphibians) seemed to be mainly confined to local connectivity patterns. Our results reveal that body size and dispersal mode are important drivers of metacommunity structure and these traits should therefore be considered when developing a predictive framework for metacommunity dynamics.},

  abstract = {The influence of spatial processes on diversity and community dynamics is generally recognized in ecology and also applied to conservation projects involving forest and grassland ecosystems. Riverine ecosystems, however, have been for a long time viewed from a local or linear perspective, even though the treelike branching of river networks is universal. River networks (so-called dendritic networks) are not only structured in a hierarchic way, but the dendritic landscape structure and physical flows often dictate distance and directionality of dispersal. Theoretical models suggest that the specific riverine network structure directly affects diversity patterns. Recent experimental and comparative data are supporting this idea. Here, I provide an introduction on theoretical findings suggesting that genetic diversity, heterozygosity and species richness are higher in dendritic systems compared to linear or two-dimensional lattice landscapes. The characteristic diversity patterns can be explained in a network perspective, which also offers universal metrics to better understand and protect riverine diversity. I show how appropriate metrics describing network centrality and dispersal distances are superior to classic measures still applied in aquatic ecology, such as Strahler order or Euclidian distance. Finally, knowledge gaps and future directions of research are identified. The network perspective employed here may help to generalize findings on riverine biodiversity research and can be applied to conservation and river restoration projects.},

  abstract = {Population viability analysis (PVA) models are used to estimate population extinction risk under different scenarios. Both simple and complex PVA models are developed and have their specific pros and cons; the question therefore arises whether we always use the most appropriate model type. Generally, the specific purpose of a model and the availability of data are listed as determining the choice of model type, but this has not been formally tested yet. We quantified the relative importance of model purpose and nine metrics of data availability and resolution for the choice of a PVA model type, while controlling for effects of the different life histories of the modelled species. We evaluated 37 model pairs: each consisting of a generally simpler, population-based model (PBM) and a more complex, individual-based model (IBM) developed for the same species. The choice of model type was primarily affected by the availability and resolution of demographic, dispersal and spatial data. Low-resolution data resulted in the development of less complex models. Model purpose did not affect the choice of the model type. We confirm the general assumption that poor data availability is the main reason for the wide use of simpler models, which may have limited predictive power for population responses to changing environmental conditions. Conservation biology is a crisis discipline where researchers learned to work with the data at hand. However, for threatened and poorly-known species, there is no short-cut when developing either a PBM or an IBM: investments to collect appropriately detailed data are required to ensure PVA models can assess extinction risk under complex environmental conditions.},

In the final sampling, a total of 21 species (12 prey and 9 predators) of insects, crustaceans, and amphibians had colonized the mesocosms. We found that total species richness, as well as the richness of predators and prey, declined with increasing isolation.

  abstract = {Chlorophyll, primary production, zooplankton biomass and the species composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton were studied in 2003, after the Prestige shipwreck. The information obtained was compared to previous data series available for the area affected by the spill. A large data series on plankton variables for the N\textendash{}NW Spanish coast existed, and therefore a realistic evaluation of the effects by comparison with the range of natural variability could be carried out. We emphasized the evaluation of impact during the spring bloom, the first important biological event after the spill. Some minor changes were observed occasionally, but they did not show any clear pattern and were more related to the natural variability of the ecosystem than to effect of the spill. Plankton community structure did not undergo any changes. Only a few species were more abundant during spring 2003 than in previous years. No significant changes were detected in the planktonic community during productive periods, such as the spring bloom and the summer blooms related to intrusions of East North Atlantic Central Waters. The lack of evidence of the effects of the spill on planktonic communities is discussed in terms of the characteristics of the fuel, the high dynamics of the water masses, the biological mechanisms through which the fuel from the surface waters is transferred to the sea floor and, particularly, the influence of the natural variability by means of large and meso-scale hydrographic processes in the area under study. At the present time it is not possible to determine any minor effects the spill may have had on the plankton owing to the great variability of the planktonic cycles and the short-term impact of the oil from the Prestige on the pelagic system.},

We performed a 16-month factorial experimental manipulation of warming, nutrient enrichment, and predator presence in replicated freshwater pond mesocosms to test their independent and interactive impacts. Warming strengthened trophic cascades from fish to primary producers, and it decreased the impact of eutrophication on the mean and temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass. These impacts varied seasonally, with higher temperatures leading to stronger trophic cascades in winter and weaker algae blooms under eutrophication in summer. Our results suggest that higher temperatures may shift the control of primary production in freshwater ponds toward stronger top-down and weaker bottom-up effects. The dampened temporal variability of algal biomass under eutrophication at higher temperatures suggests that warming may stabilize some ecosystem processes.},

  shorttitle = {Micro-Evolution Due to Pollution},
  abstract = {Polluting events can change community structure and ecosystem functioning. Selection of genetically inherited tolerance on exposed populations, here referred as micro-evolution due to pollution, has been recognized as one of the causes of these changes. However, there is a gap between studies addressing this process and those assessing effects at higher levels of biological organization. In this review we attempt to address these evolutionary considerations into the ecological risk assessment (ERA) of polluting events and to trigger the discussion about the consequences of this process for the ecosystem response to toxic stress. We provide clear evidence that pollution drives micro-evolutionary processes in several species. When this process occurs, populations inhabiting environments that become polluted may persist. However, due to the existence of ecological costs derived from the loss of genetic variability, negative pleiotropy with fitness traits and/or from physiological alterations, micro-evolution due to pollution may alter different properties of the affected populations. Despite the existence of empirical evidence showing that safety margins currently applied in the ERA process may account for pollution-induced genetic changes in tolerance, information regarding long-term ecological consequences at higher levels of biological organization due to ecological costs is not explicitly considered in these procedures. In relation to this, we present four testable hypotheses considering that micro-evolution due to pollution acts upon the variability of functional response traits of the exposed populations and generates changes on their functional effect traits, therefore, modifying the way species exploit their ecological niches and participate in the overall ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Key variables in ecosystems tend to operate on widely different time-scales. These time-scales become relevant when a disturbance rocks the ecosystem. Here we try to explain the fast dynamics of plankton and nutrients in the water column of floodplain lakes after disturbances (inundations). We take advantage of natural experiments, that is occasional massive overflow of floodplain lakes with river water. We sampled 10 lakes in two floodplains along the Dutch river Waal monthly for 3 years, capturing the impact of three inundation events. The inundations reset the plankton as well as chemical composition of most lakes to largely the same state. While biologically inert macro-ion data reflected a large and long lasting impact of the river water, dynamics of nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton communities between lakes diverged in a few weeks to regimes characteristic for the different lakes. While one spring inundation synchronized plankton dynamics to let the subsequent clear water phase occur at the same moment in different lakes, winter inundations did not have the same effect and apparently dynamics quickly diverged. Our results showed that effects of inundations and other processes that affect the state of the ecosystem should be studied considering the level of the slow components such as the sediment nutrient pool, fish stock and macrophyte communities. Plankton communities and lake water nutrient status give a practically instantaneous reflection of the condition of these slow components. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  title = {River Network Properties Shape {$\alpha$}-Diversity and Community Similarity Patterns of Aquatic Insect Communities across Major Drainage Basins},
  volume = {40},
  issn = {1365-2699},
  abstract = {Aim

Spatial dynamics and habitat connectivity affect community composition and diversity in many ecosystems. For many decades, diversity patterns in riverine ecosystems were thought to be related to local environmental conditions. Recent theoretical work, however, suggests that diversity in rivers is strongly affected by dispersal along the dendritic landscape structure and that environmental conditions are intrinsically linked to the network position. In this study we tested hypotheses on network position by relating river network geometry and connectivity to multi-level biodiversity patterns across large scales.

Location

Three major alpine drainage basins in Switzerland were studied (Rhine, Rhone, Ticino), extending over an elevational gradient of {$>~$}2500~m and covering a total area of 41,285~km2.

Methods

We sampled all may-, stone- and caddisfly species at 217 sites which representatively cover the three river networks. Using generalized additive models, we related diversity patterns in aquatic insects to centrality within the network as a direct river network property, and to catchment area and elevation, which are related to network position.

Results

Centrality within the river network, and catchment area and elevation had significant and interacting effects on {$\alpha$}-diversity and community similarity. Alpha diversity was lowest in peripheral headwaters and at high elevations. Species richness generally increased with increasing catchment area. Well-connected, central communities within the river network had greater {$\alpha$}-diversity than more peripheral communities did. Elevation was a strong predictor of {$\alpha$}-diversity, with the most diverse communities found at mid-elevation sites. Community similarity decreased with increasing along-stream distance between sites.

Main conclusions

Our results highlight the fact that diversity patterns of aquatic insects in river systems are related to local factors such as elevation, but interact with network properties and connectivity along waterways, and differ among insect orders. These findings are consistent with dispersal-limited processes and indicate that riverine diversity should be addressed and protected taking the river network structure into account.},

Central features of such non-transitive relations are represented by the 'rock\textendash{}paper\textendash{}scissors' game, in which rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity. However, population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling spiral waves forms in the course of time. We establish that this phenomenon is robust; it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for maintenance and temporal development of ecological systems and are relevant for the formation and propagation of patterns in microbial populations or excitable media.},

Patchiness is more pronounced when dispersal is leptokurtic as is the case in many animal and plant species. These results are of particular interest because population genetic parameters such as gene flow and effective population size are commonly estimated using gene frequency divergence information assuming equilibrium conditions and island models. We show how the three forms of dispersal during colonization bring about contrasting population genetic structures and how this affects estimates of gene flow. The implications for experimental studies of the spatial dimension of population genetic structure are discussed.},

It is only recently that ecologists have fully realized that a relatively simple general theory can be readily constructed that makes some of the simplifying assumptions of the two earlier theories unnecessary. The spatially realistic metapopulation theory thereby provides a more unified framework for spatial ecology than the island theory or the classical metapopulation theory. This article describes the application of the spatially realistic metapopulation theory to real metapopulations living in highly fragmented landscapes. I discuss the principal messages for population ecology and conservation biology, and I also place this theory into a broader context of other approaches to spatial ecology.},

Although species have responded to climatic changes throughout their evolutionary history, a primary concern for wild species and their ecosystems is this rapid rate of change. We gathered information on species and global warming from 143 studies for our meta-analyses. These analyses reveal a consistent temperature-related shift, or 'fingerprint', in species ranging from molluscs to mammals and from grasses to trees. Indeed, more than 80\% of the species that show changes are shifting in the direction expected on the basis of known physiological constraints of species. Consequently, the balance of evidence from these studies strongly suggests that a significant impact of global warming is already discernible in animal and plant populations. The synergism of rapid temperature rise and other stresses, in particular habitat destruction, could easily disrupt the connectedness among species and lead to a reformulation of species communities, reflecting differential changes in species, and to numerous extirpations and possibly extinctions.},

We counted all butterflies in 19 semi-natural grassland patches in a forest-dominated landscape in southern Sweden over a 5-y period. Seven of the 44 butterfly species observed exhibited a metapopulation structure. The other species either use grassland mainly for adult feeding but not for breeding (8 species), breed both in grassland and in surrounding habitat types (19 species), or are grassland specialists but their colonization-extinction dynamics are probably not significant, since they were present in nearly all ({$>$} 80\%) patches (10 species). Occupancy was generally higher in larger patches, and tended to increase with patch connectivity. Among grassland specialists and habitat generalists, the connectivity measure tended to explain more of the variation in occupancy if the shortest dispersal paths avoiding routes over water were considered rather than a measure based on the Euclidian distance between patches. This indicates that lakes, even when they are just a few hundred metres wide, can act as barriers to dispersal for butterflies. We conclude that for many butterflies that occur in semi-natural grasslands in forest-dominated landscapes, intervening habitats are important as breeding sites or as dispersal barriers.},

I investigate how two different niche components, those that relate to species' requirements (or responses to environmental factors) versus those that relate to species' impacts (or effects on environmental factors), affect predictions about the similarity of locally co-existing species. In contrast with more conventional approaches that focus on species impacts, I focus on species responses to conclude that locally co-existing species should be more similar in such traits than expected on the basis of random assortment from a larger equilibrium regional biota. In addition, I explore the evolutionary implications of exceptions that might favour the co-existence of species with dissimilar traits (especially those that determine species' impacts on the environment) and conclude that these implications differ when species compete for shared resources, interact via shared predators, or interact via both mechanisms. The analysis developed in this paper shows that the co-existence of species that are more similar than expected by chance is not incompatible with the notion of strongly interacting species in saturated local communities near equilibrium.},

We relax several assumptions of early methods for detecting recent immigrants, using genotype data; most significantly, we allow genotype frequencies to deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions within populations. The program is demonstrated by applying it to two recently published microsatellite data sets for populations of the plant species Centaurea corymbosa and the gray wolf species Canis lupus.

A novel Monte Carlo resampling method taking into account these aspects was proposed and its efficiency was evaluated. Power and error were relatively insensitive to the frequency assumed for missing alleles. Power to identify F0 immigrants was improved by using large sample size (up to about 50 individuals) and by sampling all populations from which migrants may have originated. A combination of plotting genotype likelihoods and calculating mean genotype likelihood ratios (DLR) appeared to be an effective way to predict whether F0 immigrants could be identified for a particular pair of populations using a given set of markers.},

Our simulations show that local competition can enhance intransitivity-mediated coexistence in the short term, yet hinder it in the long term, when compared to global competition. This occurs because local competition slows species disaggregation, allowing weaker competitors to persist longer in the shifting spatial refuges of intransitive networks, enhancing short-term coexistence. Conversely, our simulations show that, in the long term, local competition traps disaggregated species in unfavorable areas of the competitive arena, where they are excluded by superior competitors. As a result, in the long term, global intransitive competition allows a greater number of species to coexist than local intransitive competition.},

Assuming (as in previous literature) that a given gametic mass can be produced in unit time, then individual variations in gamete size may arise either from differences in the production time, or in the number of cell divisions at the time of production. Where zygote fitness is in some way related to zygote volumex, relative reproductive rates can be calculated for a range of variants with different gamete productivities (and therefore different gamete sizes). This model yields either', drive for small-producing (where the advantage of high productivity exceeds that of increased provisioning for the zygote) or drive for large-producing (in the reverse case). However in certain conditions (over part of the range of x where zygote fitness is proportional to volumex) a marked disruptive effect can be generated in which the two extremes, (large and small gamete production) are favoured. Reasons are given why selection should always lead to the establishment of a stable dimorphism in multicellular organisms. When the model is modified to include inheritance of gamete size by simple mendelian dominance, it is shown that as the initial range of variants is increased, the range of x (where fitness is proportional to volumes) which generates stable dimorphism also increases. As high anisogamy is approached, the disadvantageous dominant homozygote is lost leaving two sexes (sperm producers and ovum producers) in a stable 1 : 1 ratio. Stages in the evolution of dissortative fusions are outlined. Though males with sperm which fused only with ova would be favoured throughout, females with assortatively-fusing ova may have been favoured initially. Because of a faster rate of adaptation in sperm than ova, or because of the instability of an isogametic population with assortativelyfusing ova, females face an evolutionary impasse in which the only stable solution is total committment to disassortative fusions. Males are dependent on females and propagate at their expense, rather as in a parasite-host relationship.},

  abstract = {Anisogamy (noun) (also called heterogamy) refers to a form of sexual reproduction involving the union or fusion of two dissimilar gametes (differing either in size and/or form) \textemdash{} anisogamous, anisogamic, (adj.). The smaller gamete is considered to be male (sperm cell), whereas the larger gamete is regarded as female (egg cell).
There are several types of anisogamy. Both gametes may be flagellated and thus motile. Alternatively, neither of the gametes may be flagellated. This situation occurs for example in some algae and plants. In the red alga Polysiphonia, large non-motile egg cells are fertilized by small, non-motile spermatia. In flowering plants, the gametes are non-motile cells within gametophytes.
The form of heterogamy that occurs in animals, including humans, is oogamy. In oogamy, a large, non-motile egg cell (ovum) is fertilized by a small, motile sperm cell (spermatozoon). The large egg cell is optimized for longevity, whereas the small sperm cell is optimized for motility and speed. The size and resources of the egg cell allow for the production of pheromones, which attract the swimming sperm cells.},

  abstract = {Local habitat size has been shown to influence colonization and extinction processes of species in patchy environments. However, species differ in body size, mobility, and trophic level, and may not respond in the same way to habitat size. Thus far, we have a limited understanding of how habitat size influences the structure of multitrophic communities and to what extent the effects may be generalizable over a broad geographic range. Here, we used water-filled bromeliads of different sizes as a natural model system to examine the effects of habitat size on the trophic structure of their inhabiting invertebrate communities. We collected composition and biomass data from 651 bromeliad communities from eight sites across Central and South America differing in environmental conditions, species pools, and the presence of large-bodied odonate predators. We found that trophic structure in the communities changed dramatically with changes in habitat (bromeliad) size. Detritivore{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}resource ratios showed a consistent negative relationship with habitat size across sites. In contrast, changes in predator{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}detritivore (prey) ratios depended on the presence of odonates as dominant predators in the regional pool. At sites without odonates, predator{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}detritivore biomass ratios decreased with increasing habitat size. At sites with odonates, we found odonates to be more frequently present in large than in small bromeliads, and predator{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}detritivore biomass ratios increased with increasing habitat size to the point where some trophic pyramids became inverted. Our results show that the distribution of biomass amongst food-web levels depends strongly on habitat size, largely irrespective of geographic differences in environmental conditions or detritivore species compositions. However, the presence of large-bodied predators in the regional species pool may fundamentally alter this relationship between habitat size and trophic structure. We conclude that taking into account the response and multitrophic effects of dominant, mobile species may be critical when predicting changes in community structure along a habitat-size gradient.},

In particular, we consider the conditions under which extinction and recolonization might enhance or diminish gene flow and increase or decrease the rate of genetic differentiation relative to the static case with no extinctions. We explicitly take into account the age-structure that is established within the array of populations by the extinction and colonization process. We also consider two different models of the colonization process, the socalled "migrant pool" and "propagule pool" models. Our theoretical studies indicate that the genetic effects of extinction and colonization depend upon the relative magnitudes of K, the number of individuals founding new colonies, and 2Nm, twice the number of migrants moving into extant populations. We find that these genetic effects are surprisingly insensitive to the extinction rate. We conclude that, in order to assess the genetic effects of the population dynamics, we must first answer an important empirical question that is essentially ecological: is colonization a behavior distinct from migration?},

Measures of gene flow estimated from gene frequency divergence, which assume that gene frequency distributions are at equilibrium, were inconsistent with the probable dispersal capacities of taxa. This provoked an examination of historical events as alternative explanations. Both theory and computer simulations demonstrated that when populations grow rapidly in size after founding from few individuals, the gene frequency divergence established during colonization is resistant to decay by gene exchange. Our work suggests that gene frequency distributions are often not in equilibrium and that caution should be employed in attempts to infer gene flow from them in natural populations.},

  abstract = {Literature on local genetic differentiation in freshwater zooplankton populations is reviewed. The island-like nature of limnetic habitats creates opportunities for local genetic differentiation and adaptation to develop. There is a wealth of data available on genetic differentiation among populations of zooplankton with respect to allozyme markers. Data from welldesigned studies on ecologically relevant, quantitative traits are less abundant and indicate a different pattern from that obtained using electrophoretic markers. It is argued that whereas the analysis of (quasi) neutral markers emphasizes the importance of long-lasting founder effects and genetic drift, the pattern of local genetic differentiation of ecologically relevant traits may often reflect local adaptation. In reviewing the data, the importance of temporal and spatial habitat selection in maintaining genetic polymorphism for ecologically relevant traits is emphasized, without denying the importance of stochasticity. Most available data are on Daphnia, but studies on other organisms in general confirm the patterns observed in this genus. A hypothetical scheme of the processes leading to local genetic differentiation and adaptation in zooplankton is discussed, with an indication of the data necessary to fill certain gaps in our knowledge. Attention is drawn to the frequent opportunities for local adaptation in cyclically parthenogenetic organisms (e.g., Daphnia, monogonont rotifers) and the processes leading to local adaptation in cyclically parthenogenetic, obligately parthenogenetic and obligately sexual species are compared.

  abstract = {Traditional expectations for how widely and how often freshwater invertebrates disperse differ from empirical data. Freshwater invertebrates have been characterized as frequent, widespread dispersers, particularly those that are transported passively. Our review finds that this characterization may describe the potential for dispersal in some taxa, but it is not an accurate generalization for actual dispersal rates. High variance among habitats and taxonomic groups is a consistent theme. Advances in population genetics may help resolve these issues, but underlying assumptions should be carefully tested. Further, even unbiased estimates of gene flow may not equate with individual movement, because not all dispersers survive and reproduce. Some freshwater invertebrates may exist in classic Levins metapopulations. However, other species fit into a broader metapopulation definition, where temporal dispersal via diapause is functionally equivalent to spatial dispersal. In the latter case, local extinctions and rescue effects may be rare or absent. Finally, limited dispersal rates in many taxa suggest that theories of freshwater community assembly and structure can be made more robust by integrating dispersal and local processes as joint, contingent regulators. Recent research on freshwater invertebrate dispersal has substantially advanced our basic and applied understanding of freshwaters, as well as evolutionary ecology in general.},

However, such models have been criticized, mainly because the causes of their results are hard to understand. Simple models have contributed more to the development of ecological theory. However, simple models usually neglect important aspects such as spatial heterogeneity and individual variability, and may focus too much on one of several possible causes of a phenomenon. In this paper, we present a strategy that we have found useful for improving our understanding of the way in which complex models generate their results. The strategy consists of three phases. The first phase is a thorough analysis of the model behavior with respect to a selected set of parameters (`scrutinizing'). Secondly, similar analyses are done with several simplified versions of the model (`simplifying'). In this step, relationships between state variables or species that may potentially cause incomprehensible behavior are replaced by fixed values or highly simplified relations. The last step is to explain the differences between the full and the simplified versions and to discuss the results in the light of the existing ecological theory (`synthesizing'). We argue that this way of combining analyses of simple and more elaborate models is a powerful way to gain understanding of complex systems.},

We sampled such multiple networks simultaneously in an agroecosystem. We show that the networks varied in their robustness; networks including pollinators appeared to be particularly fragile. We show that, overall, networks did not strongly covary in their robustness, which suggests that ecological restoration (for example, through agri-environment schemes) benefitting one functional group will not inevitably benefit others. Some individual plant species were disproportionately well linked to many other species. This type of information can be used in restoration management, because it identifies the plant taxa that can potentially lead to disproportionate gains in biodiversity.
Analysis of seven interconnected networks on a farm reveals that they vary in their fragility, but that they do not covary.

Herbivores on organic farms were attacked by more parasitoid species on organic farms than on conventional farms. However, differences in network structure did not translate into differences in robustness to simulated species loss and we found no difference in percentage parasitism (natural pest control) across a variety of host species. Furthermore, a manipulative field experiment demonstrated that the higher species richness of parasitoids on the organic farms did not increase mortality of a novel herbivore used to bioassay ecosystem service.

The reason for this might be that Occam's razor, which is key for minimal models exploring ideas and concepts, has been too uncritically adopted for more realistic models of systems. This can tie models too closely to certain situations, thereby preventing them from predicting the response to new conditions. We therefore advocate a new kind of parsimony to improve the application of Occam's razor. This new parsimony balances two contrasting strategies for avoiding errors in modeling: avoiding inclusion of nonessential factors (false inclusions) and avoiding exclusion of sometimes-important factors (false exclusions). It involves a synthesis of traditional modeling and analysis, used to describe the essentials of mechanistic relationships, with elements that are included in a model because they have been reported to be or can arguably be assumed to be important under certain conditions. The resulting models should be able to reflect how the internal organization of populations change and thereby generate representations of the novel behavior necessary for complex predictions, including regime shifts.},

Here, two leading experts present the fundamental quantitative principles of ecology in an accessible yet rigorous way, introducing students to the most basic of all ecological subjects, the structure and dynamics of populations.John Vandermeer and Deborah Goldberg show that populations are more than simply collections of individuals. Complex variables such as distribution and territory for expanding groups come into play when mathematical models are applied. Vandermeer and Goldberg build these models from the ground up, from first principles, using a broad range of empirical examples, from animals and viruses to plants and humans. They address a host of exciting topics along the way, including age-structured populations, spatially distributed populations, and metapopulations.This second edition of Population Ecology is fully updated and expanded, with additional exercises in virtually every chapter, making it the most up-to-date and comprehensive textbook of its kind.Provides an accessible mathematical foundation for the latest advances in ecologyFeatures numerous exercises and examples throughoutIntroduces students to the key literature in the fieldThe essential textbook for advanced undergraduates and graduate studentsAn online illustration package is available to professors},

  volume = {11},
  issn = {1745-1000},
  abstract = {Since 1998, the assessment model framework Bifrost/Captool has been used for advice on total allowable catch for the Barents Sea capelin (Mallotus villosus) stock. However, since the management is based on a target escapement strategy, and most capelin die after spawning, viewed in retrospect, there is hardly any possibility of checking whether the forecast underpinning the quota was actually realistic. The forecast using Captool for the period from 1 October up to capelin spawning time at 1 April relies on a forecast of cod abundance during this period. This estimate of cod abundance is, in turn, based on a cod assessment from the previous spring. By rerunning the Captool model, where the cod forecast is replaced with the actual amount of cod from the cod assessment model run later in time, we show that considerably smaller annual quotas would have been advised if the true amount of cod had been known when the capelin quota was set. We discuss this fact in light of the present knowledge about recruitment success of capelin during the period. Our conclusion is that either the acoustic stock size estimates of capelin have been consistently underestimating the true stock size, the predation model overestimates the natural mortality of capelin during winter, the minimum spawning stock size considered necessary to uphold normal recruitment (Blim) built into the harvest control rule is higher than needed to secure good recruitment, or a combination of these.},

  abstract = {Demands for management advice on mixed and multispecies fisheries pose many challenges, further complicated by corresponding requests for advice on the environmental impacts of alternate management options. Here, we develop, and apply to North Sea fisheries, a method for collectively assessing the effects of, and interplay between, technical interactions, multispecies interactions, and the environmental effects of fishing. Ecological interactions involving 21 species are characterized with an ensemble of 188 plausible parameterizations of size-based multispecies models, and four fleets (beam trawl, otter trawl, industrial, and pelagic) characterized with catch composition data. We use the method to evaluate biomass and economic yields, alongside the risk of stock depletion and changes in the value of community indicators, for 10 000 alternate fishing scenarios (combinations of rates of fishing mortality F and fleet configuration) and present the risk vs. reward trade-offs. Technical and multispecies interactions linked to the beam and otter trawl fleets were predicted to have the strongest effects on fisheries yield and value, risk of stock collapse and fish community indicators. Increasing beam trawl effort led to greater increases in beam trawl yield when otter trawl effort was low. If otter trawl effort was high, increases in beam trawl effort led to reduced overall yield. Given the high value of demersal species, permutations of fleet effort leading to high total yield (generated primarily by pelagic species) were not the same as permutations leading to high catch values. A transition from F for 1990 to 2010 to FMSY, but without changes in fleet configuration, reduced risk of stock collapse without affecting long-term weight or value of yield. Our approach directly addresses the need for assessment methods that treat mixed and multispecies issues collectively, address uncertainty, and take account of trade-offs between weight and value of yield, state of stocks and state of the environment.},

The method follows directly from the definition of the largest Lyapunov exponent and is accurate because it takes advantage of all the available data. We show that the algorithm is fast, easy to implement, and robust to changes in the following quantities: embedding dimension, size of data set, reconstruction delay, and noise level. Furthermore, one may use the algorithm to calculate simultaneously the correlation dimension. Thus, one sequence of computations will yield an estimate of both the level of chaos and the system complexity.},

We outline and contrast several possible MBRPs that range from those that can be readily used in current frameworks to those belonging to a broader EBFM context. We demonstrate each of the possible MBRPs using a simple two species model, motivated by walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in the eastern Bering Sea, to illustrate differences among methods. The MBRPs we outline each differ in how they approach the multiple, potentially conflicting management objectives and trade-offs of EBFM. These options for MBRPs allow multi-species models to be readily adapted for EBFM across a diversity of management mandates and approaches.},

  abstract = {Increasing centralization of the control of fisheries combined with increased knowledge of food-web relationships is likely to lead to attempts to maximize economic yield from entire food webs. With the exception of predator\textendash{}prey systems, we lack any analysis of the nature of such yield-maximizing strategies. We use simple food-web models to investigate the nature of yield- or profit-maximizing exploitation of communities including two types of three-species food webs and a variety of six-species systems with as many as five trophic levels. These models show that, for most webs, relatively few species are harvested at equilibrium and that a significant fraction of the species is lost from the web. These extinctions occur for two reasons: (1) indirect effects due to harvesting of species that had positive effects on the extinct species, and (2) intentional eradication of species that are not themselves valuable, but have negative effects on more valuable species. In most cases, the yield-maximizing harvest involves taking only species from one trophic level. In no case was an unharvested top predator part of the yield-maximizing strategy. Analyses reveal that the existence of direct density dependence in consumers has a large effect on the nature of the optimal harvest policy, typically resulting in harvest of a larger number of species. A constraint that all species must be retained in the system (a ``constraint of biodiversity conservation'') usually increases the number of species and trophic levels harvested at the yield-maximizing policy. The reduction in total yield caused by such a constraint is modest for most food webs but can be over 90\% in some cases. Independent harvesting of species within the web can also cause extinctions but is less likely to do so.},

  title = {Evaluation and Management Implications of Uncertainty in a Multispecies Size-Structured Model of Population and Community Responses to Fishing},
  volume = {6},
  issn = {2041-210X},
  abstract = {* Implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries requires advice on trade-offs among fished species and between fisheries yields and biodiversity or food web properties. However, the lack of explicit representation, analysis and consideration of uncertainty in most multispecies models has limited their application in analyses that could support management advice.

* We assessed the consequences of parameter uncertainty by developing 78~125 multispecies size-structured fish community models, with all combinations of parameters drawn from ranges that spanned parameter values estimated from data and literature. This unfiltered ensemble was reduced to 188 plausible models, the filtered ensemble (FE), by screening outputs against fish abundance data and ecological principles such as requiring species' persistence.

* Effects of parameter uncertainty on estimates of single-species management reference points for fishing mortality (FMSY, fishing mortality rate providing MSY, the maximum sustainable yield) and biomass (BMSY, biomass at MSY) were evaluated by calculating probability distributions of estimated reference points with the FE. There was a 50\% probability that multispecies FMSY could be estimated to within {$\pm$}25\% of its actual value, and a 50\% probability that BMSY could be estimated to within {$\pm$}40\% of its actual value.

* Signal-to-noise ratio was assessed for four community indicators when mortality rates were reduced from current rates to FMSY. The slope of the community size spectrum showed the greatest signal-to-noise ratio, indicating that it would be the most responsive indicator to the change in fishing mortality F. Further, the power of an ongoing international monitoring survey to detect predicted responses of size spectrum slope was higher than for other size-based metrics.

* Synthesis and applications: Application of the ensemble model approach allows explicit representation of parameter uncertainty and supports advice and management by (i) providing uncertainty intervals for management reference points, (ii) estimating working values of reference points that achieve a defined reduction in risk of not breaching the true reference point, (iii) estimating the responsiveness of population, community, food web and biodiversity indicators to changes in F, (iv) assessing the performance of indicators and monitoring programmes and (v) identifying priorities for data collection and changes to model structure to reduce uncertainty.},

We first propose a rigorous definition of the hydra effect in population models. Our results show that hydra effects typically occur in the well-known Gause-type models whenever the system dynamics are cyclic.

By combining analytical and numerical methods, we obtain the model's phase diagram near its Hopf bifurcation and quantitatively characterize the properties of the spiraling patterns arising in each phase. The phases characterizing the cyclic competition away from the Hopf bifurcation (at low mutation rate) are also investigated. Our analytical approach relies on the careful analysis of the properties of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation derived through a controlled (perturbative) multiscale expansion around the model's Hopf bifurcation.

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms allowing the maintenance of biodiversity is a central issue in biology. Evolutionary game theory, where the success of one species depends on what the others are doing, provides a promising framework to investigate this complex problem. Experiments on microbial populations have shown that cyclic local interactions promote species coexistence. In this context, rock-paper-scissors games - in which rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock - are often used to model the dynamics of populations in cyclic competition. After a brief survey of some inspiring experiments, I will discuss the subtle interplay between individuals' mobility and their local interactions in two-dimensional rock-paper-scissors systems. This leads to the loss of biodiversity above a certain mobility threshold\textasciitilde{}[1], and to the formation of spiraling patterns below the critical mobility rate\textasciitilde{}[1-4]. I will then study a generic rock-paper-scissors metapopulation model formulated on a two-dimensional grid of patches. When these have a large carrying capacity, the model's dynamics is faithfully described in terms of the system's complex Ginzburg-Landau equation properly derived from a multiscale expansion. The properties of the ensuing complex Ginzburg-Landau equation are exploited to derive the system's phase diagram and to characterize the spatio-temporal properties of the spiraling patterns in each phase. This enables us to analyze the spiral waves stability, how these are influenced by linear and nonlinear diffusion, and to discuss phenomena such as far-field breakup [5-7].\textbackslash\textbackslash{}[4pt] [1] Nature \{\textbackslash{}bf 448\}, 1046 (2007);\textbackslash\textbackslash{}[0pt] [2] Phys.\textasciitilde{}Rev.\textasciitilde{}Lett. \{\textbackslash{}bf 99\}, 238105 (2007);\textbackslash\textbackslash{}[0pt] [3] J.\textasciitilde{}Theor.\textasciitilde{}Biol. \{\textbackslash{}bf 254\}, 368 (2008);\textbackslash\textbackslash{}[0pt] [4] Eur.\textasciitilde{}Phys.\textasciitilde{}J.\textasciitilde{}B \{\textbackslash{}bf 82\} 97 (2011);\textbackslash\textbackslash{}[0pt] [5] EPL \{\textbackslash{}bf 102\}, 28012 (2013);\textbackslash\textbackslash{}[0pt] [6] Phys.\textasciitilde{}Rev.

This simple game is popular among children and adults to decide on trivial disputes that have no obvious winner, but cyclic dominance is also at the heart of predator\textendash{}prey interactions, the mating strategy of side-blotched lizards, the overgrowth of marine sessile organisms and competition in microbial populations. Cyclical interactions also emerge spontaneously in evolutionary games entailing volunteering, reward, punishment, and in fact are common when the competing strategies are three or more, regardless of the particularities of the game. Here, we review recent advances on the rock\textendash{}paper\textendash{}scissors (RPS) and related evolutionary games, focusing, in particular, on pattern formation, the impact of mobility and the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance. We also review mean-field and zero-dimensional RPS models and the application of the complex Ginzburg\textendash{}Landau equation, and we highlight the importance and usefulness of statistical physics for the successful study of large-scale ecological systems. Directions for future research, related, for example, to dynamical effects of coevolutionary rules and invasion reversals owing to multi-point interactions, are also outlined.},

  volume = {86},
  abstract = {We introduce a population model for species under cyclic competition. This model allows individuals to coexist and interact on single cells while migration takes place between adjacent cells. In contrast to the model introduced by Reichenbach, Mobilia, and Frey [Reichenbach, Mobilia, and Frey, Nature (London) 448, 1046 (2007)], we find that the emergence of spirals results in an ambiguous behavior regarding the stability of coexistence. The typical time until extinction exhibits, however, a qualitatively opposite dependence on the newly introduced nonunit carrying capacity in the spiraling and the nonspiraling regimes. This allows us to determine a critical mobility that marks the onset of this spiraling state sharply. In contrast, we demonstrate that the conventional finite size stability analysis with respect to spatial size is of limited use for identifying the onset of the spiraling regime.},

  volume = {87},
  abstract = {Transitions to absorbing states are of fundamental importance in nonequilibrium physics as well as ecology. In ecology, absorbing states correspond to the extinction of species. We here study the spatial population dynamics of three cyclically interacting species. The interaction scheme comprises both direct competition between species as in the cyclic Lotka-Volterra model, and separated selection and reproduction processes as in the May-Leonard model. We show that the dynamic processes leading to the transient maintenance of biodiversity are closely linked to attractors of the nonlinear dynamics for the overall species' concentrations. The characteristics of these global attractors change qualitatively at certain threshold values of the mobility and depend on the relative strength of the different types of competition between species. They give information about the scaling of extinction times with the system size and thereby the stability of biodiversity. We define an effective free energy as the negative logarithm of the probability to find the system in a specific global state before reaching one of the absorbing states. The global attractors then correspond to minima of this effective energy landscape and determine the most probable values for the species' global concentrations. As in equilibrium thermodynamics, qualitative changes in the effective free energy landscape indicate and characterize the underlying nonequilibrium phase transitions. We provide the complete phase diagrams for the population dynamics and give a comprehensive analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics and routes to extinction in the respective phases.},

  volume = {12},
  issn = {0305-0270},
  abstract = {We consider four categories or biological mechanisms of determinants which cause and maintain species diversity: niche relations, habitat diversity, mass effects and ecological equivalency. Two of these determinants are original to this paper: mass effect, the establishment of species in sites where they cannot be self-maintaining; and ecological equivalency, the coexistence of species with effectively identical niche and habitat requirements. The mode of action and ecological implications of each biological determinant are discussed using a schematic method for measuring alpha (community), beta (differentiation), and gamma (regional) diversities. The importance of mass effects and ecological equivalency to species richess is documented with several types of field data from Israel and California, U.S.A. Floristic richness and, in particular, the richness of floristic transitions, are discussed and interpreted by use of the biological determinants of diversity. Contact transition between distinct floras are rich predominantly because of mass effects. Transitions induced by marked environmental changes are rich because of the combined influences of habitat diversity and mass effects. The rate at which species richness increases with sample area is related to the combined effects of all four biological determinants. This complexity explains the failures of simple species-area models. The relative intensity of each determinant is related to area: niche relations are most important at within-community scales, habitat diversity most important at both within-community and landscape scales, and ecological equivalency most important at regional scales. We suggest that understanding patterns of species diversity will be enhanced by the partitioning of total species richness into the richness caused by each of the four ecologically distinct determinants of diversity.},

We propose that biodiversity provides spatial insurance for ecosystem functioning by virtue of spatial exchanges among local systems in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore this hypothesis by using a simple theoretical metacommunity model with explicit local consumer\textendash{}resource dynamics and dispersal among systems. Our model shows that variation in dispersal rate affects the temporal mean and variability of ecosystem productivity strongly and nonmonotonically through two mechanisms: spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species that tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates, and functional compensations between species that are made possible by the maintenance of species diversity. The spatial insurance effects of species diversity are highest at the intermediate dispersal rates that maximize local diversity. These results have profound implications for conservation and management. Knowledge of spatial processes across ecosystems is critical to predict the effects of landscape changes on both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services.},

  abstract = {The single-species spatially realistic patch occupancy metapopulation model is, in this study, extended to a metacommunity of many competing species. Competition is assumed to reduce the local carrying capacity (effective patch area), which in turn increases local extinction rates and reduces colonization rates because of smaller population sizes. Each species is described by three parameters: pre-competitive abundance (equilibrium incidence of patch occupancy, which reflects the rate of colonization in relation to extinction rate), the spatial range of migration, and competitive ability. The model ignores spatio\textendash{}temporal correlations caused by interspecific interactions, because in metacommunities of unequal competitors inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes, correlations in the occurrence of species are driven more by patch heterogeneity than by competition. The model allows the calculation of multispecies equilibria in patchy habitats without simulations. In general, the number of coexisting species in the metacommunity increases with decreasing strength of competition, increasing rate of colonization, and decreasing range of migration. Habitat heterogeneity in the form of spatial variation in patch areas tends to facilitate coexistence. Poor competitors may coexist with superior competitors in the patch network if the former have higher colonization rates (competition\textendash{}colonization trade-off). When migration distances are short, competition leads to spatial pattern formation: Species tend to have restricted spatial distributions in the network, but contrary to intuitive expectations, often the distributions of many species are nested. Having more dispersive species enhances both local and global diversity, whereas more local migration decreases local but increases global diversity.},

Experimental warming was crossed with treatments manipulating the presence of planktivorous fish and eutrophication through enhanced nutrient supply. We found that higher temperatures produced top-heavy food webs with lower biomass of benthic and pelagic producers, equivalent biomass of zooplankton, zoobenthos and pelagic bacteria, and more pelagic viruses. Eutrophication increased the biomass of all organisms studied, while fish had cascading positive effects on periphyton, phytoplankton and bacteria, and reduced biomass of invertebrates. Surprisingly, virus biomass was reduced in the presence of fish, suggesting the possibility for complex mechanisms of top-down control of the lytic cycle. Warming reduced the effects of eutrophication on periphyton, and magnified the already strong effects of fish on phytoplankton and bacteria. Warming, fish and nutrients all increased whole-system rates of net production despite their distinct impacts on the distribution of biomass between producers and consumers, plankton and benthos, and microbes and macrobes. Our results indicate that warming exerts a host of indirect effects on aquatic food webs mediated through shifts in the magnitudes of top-down and bottom-up forcing.},

  abstract = {For a species to colonize a site it must both arrive there by dispersal from another site and maintain positive population growth in the local environment. I experimentally tested the role of dispersal limitation in structuring the zooplankton communities of fishless ponds in southwestern Michigan. An average of 12.9 new species of rotifers and crustaceans from the region were introduced at the beginning of the experiment into the intact resident communities of seven ponds in large in situ enclosures (the invasion treatment). Introduced species were found at least once over three months in six of the seven ponds, and one species consistently colonized all three replicate enclosures in three of the ponds. However, the success rate of the introductions was low as {$>$}91\% of the species introduced immediately became extinct. In addition, introduced species remained rare throughout the experiment in every pond, comprising only 0\textendash{}2.5\% of total zooplankton community biomass. No effects of the invasion treatment were detected on total zooplankton diversity or biomass, on the biomass of native species, or on chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting that relaxing dispersal limitation for the regional pool had minimal effects on local community structure. Both the biomass of exotic species and the proportion of species introduced that successfully colonized the invasion treatment were negatively correlated with native species diversity. These patterns support the hypothesis that diversity confers resistance to invasion. The results of the invasion treatment indicated a minor role for dispersal limitation in structuring pond zooplankton communities. To test the role of interactions with resident species in excluding potential invaders, a second experiment was performed in four different ponds the following year. In addition to the control and invasion treatment, a second treatment (the resistance treatment) was imposed where the abundance of native species was reduced by filtering before the introduction of invaders. The goal of this treatment was to weaken interactions between resident species and invaders while maintaining the abiotic environment intact. Among the four ponds, 3.8 times more exotic species were found in the resistance treatment than in the invasion treatment, and their total biomass was 16.4 times greater. The contrast between the invasion and resistance treatments indicated an important role for species interactions in repelling invaders. The two experiments showed that zooplankton communities were nearly saturated with species and that biotic interactions excluded many potential invaders.},

  abstract = {Metacommunity theory suggests that relationships between diversity and ecosystem stability can be determined by the rate of species dispersal among local communities. The predicted relationships, however, may depend upon the relative strength of local environmental processes and disturbance. Here we evaluate the role of dispersal frequency and local predation perturbations in affecting patterns of diversity and stability in pond plankton metacommunities. Pond metacommunities were composed of three mesocosm communities: one of the three communities maintained constant ``press'' predation from a selective predator, bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus); the second community maintained ``press'' conditions without predation; and the third community experienced recurrent ``pulsed'' predation from bluegill sunfish. The triads of pond communities were connected at either no, low (0.7\%/d), or high (20\%/d) planktonic dispersal. Richness and composition of zooplankton and stability of plankton biomass and ecosystem productivity were measured at local and regional spatial scales. Dispersal significantly affected diversity such that local and regional biotas at the low dispersal rate maintained the greatest number of species. The unimodal local dispersal\textendash{}diversity relationship was predator-dependent, however, as selective press predation excluded species regardless of dispersal. Further, there was no effect of dispersal on beta diversity because predation generated local conditions that selected for distinct community assemblages. Spatial and temporal ecosystem stability responded to dispersal frequency but not predation. Low dispersal destabilized the spatial stability of producer biomass but stabilized temporal ecosystem productivity. The results indicate that selective predation can prevent species augmentation from mass effects but has no apparent influence on stability. Dispersal rates, in contrast, can have significant effects on both species diversity and ecosystem stability at multiple spatial scales in metacommunities.},

  abstract = {Ecological theory suggests that both dispersal limitation and resource limitation can exert strong effects on community assembly. However, empirical studies of community assembly have focused almost exclusively on communities with a single trophic level. Thus, little is known about the combined effects of dispersal and resource limitation on assembly of communities with multiple trophic levels. We performed a landscape-scale experiment using spatially arranged mesocosms to study effects of dispersal and resource limitation on the assembly dynamics of aquatic invertebrate communities with two trophic levels. We found that interplay between dispersal and resource limitation regulated the assembly of predator and prey trophic levels in these pond communities. Early in assembly, predators and prey were strongly dispersal limited, and resource (i.e., prey) availability did not influence predator colonization. Later in assembly, after predators colonized, resource limitation was the strongest driver of predator abundance, and dispersal limitation played a negligible role. Thus, habitat isolation affected predators directly by reducing predator colonization rate, and indirectly through the effect of distance on prey availability. Dispersal and resource limitation of predators resulted in a transient period in which predators were absent or rare in isolated habitats. This period may be important for understanding population dynamics of vulnerable prey species. Our findings demonstrate that dispersal and resource limitation can jointly regulate assembly dynamics in multi-trophic systems. They also highlight the need to develop a temporal picture of the assembly process in multi-trophic communities because the availability and spatial distribution of limiting resources (i.e., prey) and the distribution of predators can shift radically over time.},

To test this, we manipulated both rates of habitat connectivity and the geometric arrangement of habitat heterogeneity within regions of experimental zooplankton communities. We found no effects of habitat geometry on any metric of species diversity or composition. Additionally, we found no effect of habitat connectivity rate on local species diversity. We did, however, find that increasing connectivity led to a decrease in regional diversity, as well as an increase in the percent similarity of local communities within regions. Of all of the species in these communities, the relatively large cladoceran Ceriodaphnia reticulata significantly responded to the treatments, and had a higher probability of achieving high densities when connectance was high. As such, we suggest that this species played a large role in driving the increased local community similarity and decreased regional species richness as connectivity increased. These findings are in opposition to previous experimental studies of metacommunities, but support the notion that increased connectance among local patches may decrease regional diversity when patches are heterogeneous.},

  abstract = {The spatial insurance hypothesis predicts that intermediate rates of dispersal between patches in a metacommunity allow species to track favourable conditions, preserving diversity and stabilizing biomass at local and regional scales. However, theory is unclear as to whether dispersal will provide spatial insurance when environmental conditions are changing directionally. In particular, increased temperatures as a result of climate change are expected to cause synchronous growth or decline across species and communities, and this has the potential to erode the stabilizing compensatory dynamics facilitated by dispersal. Here we report on an experimental test of how dispersal affects the diversity and stability of metacommunities under warming using replicate two-patch pond zooplankton metacommunities. Initial differences in local community composition and abiotic conditions were established by seeding each patch in the metacommunities with plankton and sediment from one of two natural ponds that differed in water chemistry and species composition. We exposed metacommunities to a 2\textdegree{}C increase in average ambient temperature, crossed with three rates of dispersal (none, intermediate, high). In ambient conditions, intermediate dispersal rates preserved diversity and stabilized metacommunities by promoting spatially asynchronous fluctuations in biomass, especially between local populations of the dominant genus, Ceriodaphnia. However, warming synchronized their populations so that these effects of dispersal were lost. Furthermore, because the stabilizing effect of dispersal was primarily due to asynchronous fluctuations between populations of a single genus, metacommunity biomass was stabilized, but dispersal did not stabilize local community biomass. Our results show that dispersal can preserve diversity and provide stability to metacommunities, but also show that this benefit can be eroded when warming is directional and synchronous across patches of a metacommunity, as is expected with climate warming.},

  abstract = {One of the most crucial tasks faced by biologists today is revealing the mechanisms which account for biodiversity, yet we are still far from a full understanding of these mechanisms, and in particular the role of spatially heterogeneous population distributions. Recently, the spatially heterogeneous coexistence seen in cyclic competition models\textemdash{}in which species compete as in the game rock-paper-scissors\textemdash{}has brought them to the fore as a paradigm for biodiversity. Research into cyclic competition has so far been focused almost exclusively on stochastic lattice models with discrete space, which ignore several key dynamical aspects. In particular, such models usually assume that species disperse at the same speed. This paper aims to extend our understanding of cyclic competition by applying a reaction\textendash{}diffusion Lotka\textendash{}Volterra scheme to the problem, which allows us to vary the mobility of each species, and lets us take into account cyclic competition with more complex underlying mechanisms. In this paper we reveal an entirely new kind of cyclic competition\textemdash{}`conditional' cyclic competition, with a different underlying mechanism to `classic' cyclic competition\textemdash{}and we show that biodiversity in communities with cyclic competition in fact depends heavily on the ratios between the species mobilities. Furthermore, we show that this dependence can be completely different for conditional and classic cyclic competition. We also present a wide range of spatiotemporal patterns which are formed in the system, including spiral and target waves, spiralling patches, and irregular chaotic patches. We show that the previously unknown case of conditional cyclic competition is host to a scenario of patchy co-invasion, where the spread of the population front takes place via the formation, splitting and propagation of patches of high species density. This is also an example of invasional meltdown because one competitor facilitates the invasion of the other, but unlike well-known cases of invasional meltdown the co-invaders in this system are not mutualists but antagonistic competitors, and the overall result mitigates, rather than amplifies, the damage done to the native ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Predator\textendash{}prey interactions play an important role for species composition and community dynamics at local scales, but their importance in shaping large-scale gradients of species richness remains unexplored. Here, we use global range maps, structural equation models (SEM), and comprehensive databases of dietary preferences and body masses of all terrestrial, non-volant mammals worldwide, to test whether (1) prey bottom-up or predator top-down relationships are important drivers of broad-scale species richness gradients once the environment and human influence have been accounted for, (2) predator\textendash{}prey richness associations vary among biogeographic regions, and (3) body size influences large-scale covariation between predators and prey. SEMs including only productivity, climate, and human factors explained a high proportion of variance in prey richness (R2 = 0.56) but considerably less in predator richness (R2 = 0.13). Adding predator-to-prey or prey-to-predator paths strongly increased the explained variance in both cases (prey R2 = 0.79, predator R2 = 0.57), suggesting that predator\textendash{}prey interactions play an important role in driving global diversity gradients. Prey bottom-up effects prevailed over productivity, climate, and human influence to explain predator richness, whereas productivity and climate were more important than predator top-down effects for explaining prey richness, although predator top-down effects were still significant. Global predator\textendash{}prey associations were not reproduced in all regions, indicating that distinct paleoclimate and evolutionary histories (Africa and Australia) may alter species interactions across trophic levels. Stronger cross-trophic-level associations were recorded within categories of similar body size (e.g., large prey to large predators) than between them (e.g., large prey to small predators), suggesting that mass-related energetic and physiological constraints influence broad-scale richness links, especially for large-bodied mammals. Overall, our results support the idea that trophic interactions can be important drivers of large-scale species richness gradients in combination with environmental effects.},

However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning potential feedback between the biota and the climate. In particular, it is unclear how global warming will affect the metabolic balance between the photosynthetic fixation and respiratory release of CO2 at the ecosystem scale. Here, we present a combination of experimental field data from freshwater mesocosms, and theoretical predictions derived from the metabolic theory of ecology to investigate whether warming will alter the capacity of ecosystems to absorb CO2. Our manipulative experiment simulated the temperature increases predicted for the end of the century and revealed that ecosystem respiration increased at a faster rate than primary production, reducing carbon sequestration by 13 per cent. These results confirmed our theoretical predictions based on the differential activation energies of these two processes. Using only the activation energies for whole ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration we provide a theoretical prediction that accurately quantified the precise magnitude of the reduction in carbon sequestration observed experimentally. We suggest the combination of whole-ecosystem manipulative experiments and ecological theory is one of the most promising and fruitful research areas to predict the impacts of climate change on key ecosystem services.},

Whole ecosystem CH4 efflux was strongly related to temperature with an apparent activation energy of 0.85~eV. Furthermore, CH4 efflux increased faster than ER or GPP with temperature, with all three processes having sequentially lower activation energies. Warming of 4~\textdegree{}C increased the fraction of GPP effluxing as CH4 by 20\% and the fraction of ER as CH4 by 9\%, in line with the offset in their respective activation energies. Because CH4 is 21 times more potent as a greenhouse gas, relative to CO2, these results suggest freshwater ecosystems could drive a previously unknown positive feedback between warming and the carbon cycle.},

So, how will fisheries management measures contribute to ecosystem functioning and the attainment of environmental objectives as measured by improvements in indicators of biodiversity and food webs? We model ecosystem effects of fishing in the North Sea using food web model projections incorporating fishing effort strategies consistent with MSY targets. Correlations between modelled indicators and survey data were significant ( p {$\leq$} 0.02 ). Reduced fishing effort led to increases in size-based indicators and biomasses of benthivores, planktivores and piscivores. However, predation by piscivores depressed bentho-piscivore biomass. Climate warming may also decrease biomasses of bentho-piscivores and piscivores, while planktivores, benthivores and state indicators of size and trophic level may increase. Fisheries management measures will benefit the biodiversity of the fish community in terms of size structure, but not necessarily the food web since decreases in relative biomass of some trophic guilds are expected.},

An example is the EU's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which requires Member States to take measures to reach ``good environmental status'' (GES) in European marine waters. However, formulation of indicator targets consistent with the Directive's high-level policy goal of sustainable use has proven challenging. We develop a specific, quantitative interpretation of the concepts of GES and sustainable use in terms of indicators and associated targets, by sharply distinguishing between current uses to satisfy current societal needs and preferences, and unknown future uses. We argue that consistent targets to safeguard future uses derive from a requirement that any environmental state indicator should recover within a defined time (e.g. 30 years) to its pressure-free range of variation when all pressures are hypothetically removed. Within these constraints, specific targets for current uses should be set. Routes to implementation of this proposal for indicators of fish-community size structure, population size of selected species, eutrophication, impacts of non-indigenous species, and genetic diversity are discussed. Important policy implications are that (a) indicator target ranges, which may be wider than natural ranges, systematically and rationally derive from our proposal; (b) because relevant state indicators tend to respond slowly, corresponding pressures should also be monitored and assessed; (c) support of current uses and safeguarding of future uses are distinct management goals, they require different types of targets, decision processes, and management philosophies.},

In this study, we quantified and compared temporal changes in the abundance, taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and phylogenetic diversity of bird assemblages, using roadside monitoring data of the North American Breeding Bird Survey from 1971 to 2010. We calculated 12 abundance and diversity metrics based on 5-year average abundances of 519 species for each of 768 monitoring routes. We did this for all bird species together as well as for four subgroups based on breeding habitat affinity (grassland, woodland, wetland, and shrubland breeders). The majority of the biodiversity metrics increased or remained constant over the study period, whereas the overall abundance of birds showed a pronounced decrease, primarily driven by declines of the most abundant species. These results highlight how stable or even increasing metrics of taxonomic, functional, or phylogenetic diversity may occur in parallel with substantial losses of individuals. We further found that patterns of change differed among the species subgroups, with both abundance and diversity increasing for woodland birds and decreasing for grassland breeders. The contrasting changes between abundance and diversity and among the breeding habitat groups underscore the relevance of a multifaceted approach to measuring biodiversity change. Our findings further stress the importance of monitoring the overall abundance of individuals in addition to metrics of taxonomic, functional, or phylogenetic diversity, thus confirming the importance of population abundance as an essential biodiversity variable.},

Biodiversity protection is a major target of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, requiring assessment of the status of biodiversity on the level of species, habitats, and ecosystems including genetic diversity and the role of biodiversity in food web functioning and structure. This paper provides a summary of the development of new indicators and refinement of existing ones in order to address some of the observed gaps in indicator availability for marine biodiversity assessments considering genetic, species, habitat, and ecosystem levels. Promising new indicators are available addressing genetic diversity of microbial and benthic communities. Novel indicators to assess biodiversity and food webs associated with habitats formed by keystone species (such as macroalgae) as well as to map benthic habitats (such as biogenic reefs) using high resolution habitat characterization were developed. We also discuss the advances made on indicators for detecting impacts of non-native invasive species and assessing the structure and functioning of marine food-webs. The latter are based on indicators showing the effects of fishing on trophic level and size distribution of fish and elasmobranch communities well as phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure as food web indicators. New and refined indicators are ranked based on quality criteria. Their applicability for various EU and global biodiversity assessments and the need for further development of new indicators and refinement of the existing ones is discussed.},

Integrated Ecosystem Assessment is required by the Directive in order to assess Good Environmental Status (GES). Ecological modeling has a key role to play within the implementation of the MSFD, as demonstrated here by case studies covering a range of spatial scales and a selection of anthropogenic threats. Modeling studies have a strong role to play in embedding data collected at limited points within a larger spatial and temporal scale, thus enabling assessments of pelagic and seabed habitat. Furthermore, integrative studies using food web and ecosystem models are able to investigate changes in food web functioning and biological diversity in response to changes in the environment and human pressures. Modeling should be used to: support the development and selection of specific indicators; set reference points to assess state and the achievement of GES; inform adaptive monitoring programs and trial management scenarios. The modus operandi proposed shows how ecological modeling could support the decision making process leading to appropriate management measures and inform new policy.},

  issn = {1466-8238},
  abstract = {Aim

To investigate the association between hummingbird\textendash{}plant network structure and species richness, phylogenetic signal on species' interaction pattern, insularity and historical and current climate.

Location

Fifty-four communities along a c. 10,000 km latitudinal gradient across the Americas (39\textdegree\,N\textendash{}32\textdegree\,S), ranging from sea level to c. 3700\,m a.s.l., located on the mainland and on islands and covering a wide range of climate regimes.

Methods

We measured the level of specialization and modularity in mutualistic plant\textendash{}hummingbird interaction networks. Using an ordinary least squares multimodel approach, we examined the influence of species richness, phylogenetic signal, insularity and current and historical climate conditions on network structure (null-model-corrected specialization and modularity).

Results

Phylogenetically related species, especially plants, showed a tendency to interact with a similar array of mutualistic partners. The spatial variation in network structure exhibited a constant association with species phylogeny (R2\,=\,0.18\textendash{}0.19); however, network structure showed the strongest association with species richness and environmental factors (R2\,=\,0.20\textendash{}0.44 and R2\,=\,0.32\textendash{}0.45, respectively). Specifically, higher levels of specialization and modularity were associated with species-rich communities and communities in which closely related hummingbirds visited distinct sets of flowering species. On the mainland, specialization was also associated with warmer temperatures and greater historical temperature stability.

Main conclusions

Our results confirm the results of previous macroecological studies of interaction networks which have highlighted the importance of species richness and the environment in determining network structure. Additionally, for the first time, we report an association between network structure and species phylogenetic signal at a macroecological scale, indicating that high specialization and modularity are associated with high interspecific competition among closely related hummingbirds, subdividing the floral niche. This suggests a tighter co-evolutionary association between hummingbirds and their plants than in previously studied plant\textendash{}bird mutualistic systems.},

  abstract = {Pollination systems are recognized as critical for the maintenance of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, the understanding of mechanisms that promote the integrity of those mutualistic assemblages is an important issue for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. In this study we present a new population dynamics model for plant\textendash{}pollinator interactions that is based on the consumer\textendash{}resource approach and incorporates a few essential features of pollination ecology. The model was used to project the temporal dynamics of three empirical pollination network, in order to analyze how adaptive foraging of pollinators (AF) shapes the outcome of community dynamics in terms of biodiversity and network robustness to species loss. We found that the incorporation of AF into the dynamics of the pollination networks increased the persistence and diversity of its constituent species, and reduced secondary extinctions of both plants and animals. These findings were best explained by the following underlying processes: 1) AF increased the amount of floral resources extracted by specialist pollinators, and 2) AF raised the visitation rates received by specialist plants. We propose that the main mechanism by which AF enhanced those processes is (trophic) niche partitioning among animals, which in turn generates (pollen vector) niche partitioning among plants. Our results suggest that pollination networks can maintain their stability and diversity by the adaptive foraging of generalist pollinators.},

@article{Lynam16:_UsesInnovative,
  title = {Uses of {{Innovative Modeling Tools}} within the {{Implementation}} of the {{Marine Strategy Framework Directive}}},
  abstract = {In Europe and around the world, the approach to management of the marine environment has developed from the management of single issues (e.g., species and/or pressures) toward holistic Ecosystem Based Management (EBM) that includes aims to maintain biological diversity and protect ecosystem functioning. Within the European Union, this approach is implemented through the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC). Integrated Ecosystem Assessment is required by the Directive in order to assess Good Environmental Status (GES). Ecological modeling has a key role to play within the implementation of the MSFD, as demonstrated here by case studies covering a range of spatial scales and a selection of anthropogenic threats. Modeling studies have a strong role to play in embedding data collected at limited points within a larger spatial and temporal scale, thus enabling assessments of pelagic and seabed habitat. Furthermore, integrative studies using food web and ecosystem models are able to investigate changes in food web functioning and biological diversity in response to changes in the environment and human pressures. Modeling should be used to: support the development and selection of specific indicators; set reference points to assess state and the achievement of GES; inform adaptive monitoring programs and trial management scenarios. The modus operandi proposed shows how ecological modeling could support the decision making process leading to appropriate management measures and inform new policy.},

  issn = {0006-3207},
  abstract = {A large number of diversity metrics are available to study and monitor biodiversity, and their responses to biodiversity changes are not necessarily coherent with each other. The choice of biodiversity metrics may thus strongly affect our interpretation of biodiversity change and, hence, prioritization of resources for conservation. Therefore it is crucial to understand which metrics respond to certain changes, are the most sensitive to change, show consistent responses across different communities, detect early signals of species decline, and are insensitive to demographic stochasticity. Here we generated synthetic communities and simulated changes in their composition according to 9 scenarios of biodiversity change to investigate the behaviour of 12 biodiversity metrics. Metrics showed diverse abilities to detect changes under different scenarios. S{\o}rensen similarity index, arithmetic and geometric mean abundance, and species and functional richness were the most sensitive to community changes. S{\o}rensen similarity index, species richness and geometric abundance showed consistent responses across all simulated communities and scenarios. S{\o}rensen similarity index and geometric mean abundance were able to detect early signals of species decline. Geometric mean abundance, and functional evenness under certain scenarios, had the greatest ability to distinguish directional trends from stochastic changes, but S{\o}rensen similarity index and geometric mean abundance were the only indices to show consistent signals under all replicates and scenarios. Classic abundance-weighted heterogeneity indices (e.g. Shannon index) were insensitive to certain changes or showed misleading responses, and are therefore unsuitable for comparison of biological communities. We therefore suggest that separate metrics of species composition, richness, and abundance should be reported instead of (or in addition to) composite metrics like the Shannon index.},

  abstract = {The European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) seeks to achieve, for all European seas, ``Good Environmental Status'' (GEnS), by 2020. Ecological models are currently one of the strongest approaches used to predicting and understanding the consequences of anthropogenic and climate-driven changes in the natural environment. We assess the most commonly used capabilities of the modelling community to provide information about indicators outlined in the MSFD, particularly on biodiversity, food webs, non-indigenous species and seafloor integrity descriptors. We built a catalogue of models and their derived indicators to assess which models were able to demonstrate: (1) the linkages between indicators and ecosystem structure and function and (2) the impact of pressures on ecosystem state through indicators. Our survey identified 44 ecological models being implemented in Europe, with a high prevalence of those that focus on links between hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry, followed by end-to-end, species distribution/habitat suitability, bio-optical (remote sensing) and multispecies models. Approximately 200 indicators could be derived from these models, the majority of which were biomass and physical/hydrological/chemical indicators. Biodiversity and food webs descriptors, with {$\sim$}49\% and {$\sim$}43\% respectively, were better addressed in the reviewed modelling approaches than the non-indigenous species (0.3\%) and sea floor integrity ({$\sim$}8\%) descriptors. Out of 12 criteria and 21 MSFD indicators relevant to the abovementioned descriptors, currently only three indicators were not addressed by the 44 models reviewed. Modelling approaches showed also the potential to inform on the complex, integrative ecosystem dimensions while addressing ecosystem fundamental properties, such as interactions between structural components and ecosystems services provided, despite the fact that they are not part of the MSFD indicators set. The cataloguing of models and their derived indicators presented in this study, aim at helping the planning and integration of policies like the MSFD which require the assessment of all European Seas in relation to their ecosystem status and pressures associated and the establishment of environmental targets (through the use of indicators) to achieve GEnS by 2020.},

  abstract = {Abundance and biomass of cod, haddock, and whiting in the waters off of the west coast of Scotland (wcoS) have undergone large changes in recent years, most notably a recent decline. These three species contribute a considerable part of Scottish demersal landings from this area and as such it is important to understand why these stocks are behaving the way they are. A number of explanations for the decline have been proposed, including: seal predation, pressure from Nephrops trawls, and fishing pressure more generally. We used an ecosystem model of the wcoS continental shelf ({$<$}200 m depth) to investigate whether these proposed explanations for declining gadoid stocks are feasible. Results suggest that the rise in the grey seal population over recent years has not led to the decline in gadoid stocks; there is insufficient bycatch by the Nephrops fleet to have a large impact on gadoid stocks; however, fishing, as a key driver of the west of Scotland shelf ecosystem, has impacted stocks and by decreasing fishing levels to maximum sustainable yield cod biomass may increase slightly though not returning to previous levels. Although this means we are little further forward in understanding the cause of recent gadoid declines in the area, the development of this model has enabled us to further our knowledge and understanding of aspects of trophic structure and the impacts of fishing on the wcoS.},

  abstract = {Abstract:\hspace{0.6em}The task of measuring the decline of global biodiversity and instituting changes to halt and reverse this downturn has been taken up in response to the Convention on Biological Diversity's 2010 target. It is an undertaking made more difficult by the complex nature of biodiversity and the consequent difficulty in accurately gauging its depletion. In the Living Planet Index, aggregated population trends among vertebrate species indicate the rate of change in the status of biodiversity, and this index can be used to address the question of whether or not the 2010 target has been achieved. We investigated the use of generalized additive models in aggregating large quantities of population trend data, evaluated potential bias that results from collation of existing trends, and explored the feasibility of disaggregating the data (e.g., geographically, taxonomically, regionally, and by thematic area). Our results show strengths in length and completeness of data, little evidence of bias toward threatened species, and the possibility of disaggregation into meaningful subsets. Limitations of the data set are still apparent, in particular the dominance of bird data and gaps in tropical-species population coverage. Population-trend data complement the longer-term, but more coarse-grained, perspectives gained by evaluating species-level extinction rates. To measure progress toward the 2010 target, indicators must be adapted and strategically supplemented with existing data to generate meaningful indicators in time. Beyond 2010, it is critical a strategy be set out for the future development of indicators that will deal with existing data gaps and that is intricately tied to the goals of future biodiversity targets.},

An LFI calculated from an eight-species subset correlated closely with the full community LFI, thereby permitting an exploration of the effects of various fishing scenarios on projected values of the LFI using an extension of a previously published multi-species length-structured model that included these key species. The model replicated historical changes in biomass and size composition of individual species, and generated an LFI that was significantly correlated with observations. A community-wide reduction in fishing mortality of {$\sim$}60\% from 2008 values was necessary to meet the LFI target, driven mainly by changes in cod and saithe. A 70\% reduction in cod fishing mortality alone, or a 75\% reduction in otter trawl effort, was also sufficient to achieve the target. Reductions in fishing mortality necessary to achieve maximum sustainable harvesting rates are projected to result in the LFI over-shooting its target.},

  abstract = {Responses of zooplankton, pelagic primary producers, planktonic bacteria, and CO2 exchange with the atmosphere were measured in four lakes with contrasting food webs under a range of nutrient enrichments during a seven-year period. Prior to enrichment, food webs were manipulated to create contrasts between piscivore dominance and planktivore dominance. Nutrient enrichments of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus exhibited ratios of N:P {$>$} 17:1, by atoms, to maintain P limitation. An unmanipulated reference lake, Paul Lake, revealed baseline variability but showed no trends that could confound the interpretation of changes in the nearby manipulated lakes. Herbivorous zooplankton of West Long Lake (piscivorous fishes) were large-bodied Daphnia spp., in contrast to the small-bodied grazers that predominated in Peter Lake (planktivorous fishes). At comparable levels of nutrient enrichment, Peter Lake's areal chlorophyll and areal primary production rates exceeded those of West Long Lake by factors of approximately three and six, respectively. Grazers suppressed pelagic primary producers in West Long Lake, relative to Peter Lake, even when nutrient input rates were so high that soluble reactive phosphorus accumulated in the epilimnions of both lakes during summer. Peter Lake also had higher bacterial production (but not biomass) than West Long Lake. Hydrologic changes that accompanied manipulation of East Long Lake caused concentrations of colored dissolved organic carbon to increase, leading to considerable variability in fish and zooplankton populations. Both trophic cascades and water color appeared to inhibit the response of primary producers to nutrients in East Long Lake. Carbon dioxide was discharged to the atmosphere by Paul Lake in all years and by the other lakes prior to nutrient addition. During nutrient addition, only Peter Lake consistently absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere, due to high rates of carbon fixation by primary producers. In contrast, CO2 concentrations of West Long Lake shifted to near-atmospheric levels, and net fluxes were near zero, while East Long Lake continued to discharge CO2 to the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Based on data from 233 Danish lakes, enclosure experiments, full-scaleexperiments and published empirical models we present evidence that top-downcontrol is more important in shallow lakes than in deep lakes, excepting lakeswith a high abundance of submerged macrophytes. The evidence in support is: (1)That at a given epilimnion total phosphorus concentration (TP) the biomass offish per m2 is independent of depth, which means that biomassper m3is markedly higher in shallow lakes. (2) That the biomass of benthic invertebratesis higher in shallow lakes, which means that the benthi-planktivorous fish areless dependent on zooplankton prey than in deep lakes. By their ability to shiftto zooplankton predation their density can remain high even in periods whenzooplankton is scarce and they can thereby maintain a potentially high predationpressure on zooplankton. (3) That the possibilities of cladocerans to escapepredation by vertical migration are less. (4) That the zooplankton:phytoplanktonmass ratio per m2 is lower and presumably then also thegrazing pressure onphytoplankton. (5) That nutrient constraints appear to be weaker, as evidenced bythe fact that at a given annual mean TP, summer TP is considerably higher inshallow lakes, especially in eutrophic lakes lacking submerged macrophytes. (6)That negative feedback on cladocerans by cyanobacteria is lower as cyanobacterialdominance is less frequent in shallow lakes and more easily broken (at least inNorthern temperate lakes), and (7) That top-down control by benthi-planktivorousfish is markedly reduced in lakes rich in submerged macrophytes because theplants serve as a refuge for pelagic cladocerans and encouragepredatory fish at the expense of prey fish. We conclude that manipulation of fishand submerged macrophytes may have substantial impact on lake ecosystems, inparticular in shallow eutrophic lakes. On the contrary, if the conditions formore permanent changes in plant abundance or fish community structure are lackingthe feed-back mechanisms that endeavour a return to the original turbid state willbe particularly strong in shallow lakes.},

  volume = {116},
  issn = {1600-0706},
  abstract = {Prey diversity is thought to mediate the strength of top-down and bottom-up effects, but few experiments directly test this hypothesis. I assembled food webs of bacteria and bacterivorous protist prey in laboratory microcosms with all combinations of five productivity levels, two top predator treatments (present or absent), and three prey compositions. Depauperate food chains contained one of two edible prey species, while more diverse food webs contained both edible prey species plus two additional less-edible/inedible prey. Equilibrium theory predicts that prey diversity should weaken the top-down and bottom-up effects on trophic level biomasses, due to density compensation among prey species. Top-down effects should increase with productivity in food chains, but decrease with productivity in food webs. Results revealed highly dynamic top-down effects, the strength of which varied more over time than among treatments. Further, top-down effects did not merely vary in absolute strength over time, but also in relative strength across different prey compositions and productivity levels. It might be expected that equilibrium models would qualitatively reproduce time-averaged results. However, time-averaged data largely failed to support equilibrium predictions. This failure may reflect strong temporal variability in treatment effects combined with nonlinear density dependence of species' per-capita growth rates. Strong temporal variability in the strength of top-down effects has not previously been demonstrated, but likely is common in nature as well.},

  abstract = {Trophic cascades have been documented in a diversity of ecological systems and can be important in determining biomass distribution within a community. To date, the literature on trophic cascades has focused on whether and in which systems cascades occur. Many biological (e.g., productivity\,:\,biomass ratios) and methodological (e.g., experiment size or duration) factors vary with the ecosystem in which data were collected, but ecosystem type, per se, does not provide mechanistic insights into factors controlling cascade strength. Here, we tested various hypotheses about why trophic cascades occur and what determines their magnitude using data from 114 studies that measured the indirect trophic effects of predators on plant community biomass in seven aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Using meta-analysis, we examined the relationship between the indirect effect of predator manipulation on plants and 18 biological and methodological factors quantified from these studies. We found, in contrast to predictions, that high system productivity and low species diversity do not consistently generate larger trophic cascades. A combination of herbivore and predator metabolic factors and predator taxonomy (vertebrate vs. invertebrate) explained 31\% of the variation in cascade strength among all 114 studies. Within systems, 18\% of the variation in cascade strength was explained with similar predator and herbivore characteristics. Within and across all systems, the strongest cascades occurred in association with invertebrate herbivores and endothermic vertebrate predators. These associations may result from a combination of true biological differences among species with different physiological requirements and bias among organisms studied in different systems. Thus, although cascade strength can be described by biological characteristics of predators and herbivores, future research on indirect trophic effects must further examine biological and methodological differences among studies and systems.},

  title = {Lake Responses to Reduced Nutrient Loading \textendash{} an Analysis of Contemporary Long-Term Data from 35 Case Studies},
  volume = {50},
  issn = {1365-2427},
  abstract = {1. This synthesis examines 35 long-term (5\textendash{}35~years, mean: 16~years) lake re-oligotrophication studies. It covers lakes ranging from shallow (mean depth {$<$}5~m and/or polymictic) to deep (mean depth up to 177~m), oligotrophic to hypertrophic (summer mean total phosphorus concentration from 7.5 to 3500~{$\mu$}g~L-1 before loading reduction), subtropical to temperate (latitude: 28\textendash{}65\textdegree{}), and lowland to upland (altitude: 0\textendash{}481~m). Shallow north-temperate lakes were most abundant. 2. Reduction of external total phosphorus (TP) loading resulted in lower in-lake TP concentration, lower chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and higher Secchi depth in most lakes. Internal loading delayed the recovery, but in most lakes a new equilibrium for TP was reached after 10\textendash{}15~years, which was only marginally influenced by the hydraulic retention time of the lakes. With decreasing TP concentration, the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) also declined substantially. 3. Decreases (if any) in total nitrogen (TN) loading were lower than for TP in most lakes. As a result, the TN~:~TP ratio in lake water increased in 80\% of the lakes. In lakes where the TN loading was reduced, the annual mean in-lake TN concentration responded rapidly. Concentrations largely followed predictions derived from an empirical model developed earlier for Danish lakes, which includes external TN loading, hydraulic retention time and mean depth as explanatory variables. 4. Phytoplankton clearly responded to reduced nutrient loading, mainly reflecting declining TP concentrations. Declines in phytoplankton biomass were accompanied by shifts in community structure. In deep lakes, chrysophytes and dinophytes assumed greater importance at the expense of cyanobacteria. Diatoms, cryptophytes and chrysophytes became more dominant in shallow lakes, while no significant change was seen for cyanobacteria. 5. The observed declines in phytoplankton biomass and chl a may have been further augmented by enhanced zooplankton grazing, as indicated by increases in the zooplankton~:~phytoplankton biomass ratio and declines in the chl a~:~TP ratio at a summer mean TP concentration of {$<$}100\textendash{}150~{$\mu$}g~L-1. This effect was strongest in shallow lakes. This implies potentially higher rates of zooplankton grazing and may be ascribed to the observed large changes in fish community structure and biomass with decreasing TP contribution. In 82\% of the lakes for which data on fish are available, fish biomass declined with TP. The percentage of piscivores increased in 80\% of those lakes and often a shift occurred towards dominance by fish species characteristic of less eutrophic waters. 6. Data on macrophytes were available only for a small subsample of lakes. In several of those lakes, abundance, coverage, plant volume inhabited or depth distribution of submerged macrophytes increased during oligotrophication, but in others no changes were observed despite greater water clarity. 7. Recovery of lakes after nutrient loading reduction may be confounded by concomitant environmental changes such as global warming. However, effects of global change are likely to run counter to reductions in nutrient loading rather than reinforcing re-oligotrophication.},

  abstract = {The strength of trophic cascades in the pelagic area of lakes at low productivity has been discussed intensively, but predictions of trophic coupling differ strongly. Many studies suggest that trophic cascades are weak in oligotrophic lakes, but some models discussed that trophic interactions might be strong at low nutrient concentration. Here, we used time series over 9 (phytoplankton and zooplankton) or 6 (fish) years from the oligo-mesotrophic Lake Stechlin (Germany) to explore correlative relationships between biomasses of these trophic levels. The fourth trophic level of piscivorous fish was almost absent in the pelagic area. The biomass of planktivorous coregonid fishes was not at all correlated to total zooplankton biomass, which was dominated by calanoid copepods. However, there was a strong negative correlation of adult coregonid biomass to the proportion of Daphnia in zooplankton, and a strong positive correlation of adult fish to proportion of calanoid copepods. Zooplankton and phytoplankton biomasses were not correlated except for a significantly negative correlation between Daphnia biomass and biomass of Cyanobacteria. Overall, our results suggest that planktivorous fish may modify the zooplankton structure, but not the zooplankton biomass, in lakes of low productivity. However, this top-down effect by fish does not cascade further down to the phytoplankton biomass or community structure, confirming earlier hypotheses that trophic cascades are weak in oligotrophic lakes.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The effects of major reductions in organic matter, total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) loading on the chemical environment, trophic structure, and dynamics of the hypertrophic, shallow Lake S{\o}byg{\aa}rd were followed for 18 years. After the reduction in organic matter loading in 1976, the lake initially shifted from a summer clear-water state, most likely reflecting high grazing pressure by large Daphniaspecies, to a turbid state with extremely high summer mean chlorophyll a (up to 1400 {$\mu$}g L-1), high pH (up to 10.2), and low zooplankton grazing. Subsequently, a more variable state with periodically high grazing rates on phytoplankton and bacteria was established. Changes in zooplankton abundance and grazing could be attributed to variations in cyprinid abundance due to a fish kill (probably as a consequence of oxygen depletion) and pH-induced variations in fish recruitment and fry survival. The results suggest strong cascading effects of fish on the abundance and size of zooplankton and phytoplankton and on phytoplankton production. A comparatively weak cascading effect on ciliates and bacterioplankton is suggested. Due to high internal loading, only minor changes were observed in lake-water TP after a reduction in external TP loading of approximately 80\% in 1982; net retention of TP was still negative 13 years after the loading reduction, despite a short hydraulic retention time of a few weeks. TN, however, decreased proportionally to the TN-loading reduction in 1987, suggesting a fast N equilibration. Only minor improvement in the environmental state of the lake has been observed. We suggest that another decade will be required before the lake is in equilibrium with present external P loading.},

Less is known about the large-scale and long-term effects resulting from the introduction of fish with more generalist feeding habits, and the extent to which these effects depend on lake trophic status. Paleolimnological records of three oligotrophic lakes in Maine, USA were used to analyze the response of plankton communities to the introduction of white perch (Morone americana), a fish that often numerically dominates fish assemblages and switches from strict planktivory to a more generalist diet during ontogeny. After white perch introduction, cladoceran ephippia size increased up to 50 \%, suggesting that the most important role of this generalist fish, with respect to water quality, is as a piscivorous trophic link. Algal standing crop declined by a quarter to over a half of pre-introduction levels, suggesting that top-down effects of white perch reduced phytoplankton biomass. In comparing these oligotrophic lakes to prior work in a eutrophic system, white perch introduction had similar effects on zooplankton body size; however, cascading effects to phytoplankton were only observed in low productivity lakes.},

In rough order of their importance, water and nutrient availability, factors that deter herbivores (plant defenses, environmental heterogeneity and disturbance, nutrient stoichiometry), and consumption by herbivores appear to be the most universal determinants of the production and distribution of plant biomass. In some times and places, indirect effects from enemies of herbivores (predators, parasites, parasitoids and pathogens) propagate through the food web to influence plant biomass, in a manner somewhat consistent with green world and exploitation ecosystem mechanisms. I discuss why such food web dynamics appear to be much more important in water than on land. The only demonstrated cases of community-level trophic cascades occur in water.

Previously I developed an analytic approach for the linear chain for a press-type perturbation and applied it to ratio-dependent functional relationships. Here I extend the linear chain analysis to a more general functional relationship which allows independent variation of prey dependence and intra-level interference. I find that different combinations of prey dependence and interference lead to large or small cascading effects.

A new self-optimizing control rule, introduced here for its robustness to structural instability, led to intermediate yields. Most plans outperformed single-species management plans with pressure targets that were set without considering multispecies interactions. However, more refined plans to ``maximize the yield from each stock separately'', in the sense of a Nash equilibrium, produced total yields comparable to plans aiming to maximize total harvested biomass, and were more robust to structural instability. Our analyses highlight trade-offs between yields, amenability to negotiations, pressures on biodiversity and continuity with current approaches in the European context. Based on these results, we recommend directions for developments of EU fisheries policy.},

  abstract = {Ecological modelling should take its orientation more from real patterns observed in nature, than has been the case up to now, to overcome the deficiencies of the present strategies. Firstly, the orientation towards patterns provides guidelines about the manner and extent of the aggregation of biological information in the model. Modelling thereby loses much of its arbitrariness; secondly, pattern-oriented models are not `scale-free', i.e. they relate explicitly to spatial and temporal scales; and finally, they produce comparative predictions which are better suited for testing than the predictions achieved by models, which are only either complex or generalizing. To demonstrate the strategy of pattern-oriented modelling and its advantages, three examples from population ecology are presented: (1) In a model concerning density dependence and individual variability, the orientation towards a pattern in weight distributions requires explicit inclusion of the within-generation time scale in the model. (2) Orientation towards a pattern in the dispersal capabilities of small organisms leads to a metapopulation model, where environmental correlations about certain distances are taken into account. The survival of the metapopulation depends mainly on the ratio of the correlation distance to the range of dispersal of the organisms. (3) The wave-like pattern of the spread of rabies is reproduced by an extremely simple one-dimensional model, which is based on an extended cellular automaton approach. From this basic model, a description on finer spatial and temporal scales can be developed with the aim of constructing a model which allows for the investigation of spatial barriers against the spread of rabies. A comparison of the three example models shows that the main features of pattern-oriented models are generic. In producing comparative predictions which are related explicitly to scales, pattern-oriented modelling seems to be a strategy well suited to the `scaling up' from population ecology to community and ecosystem ecology.},

Here, we interpret these ratios in terms of the elementary processes of food intake, specific production rate, and gross growth efficiency that underlie them. Recent information confirms that the magnitude of all these processes is related to the average body mass of the organisms involved. However, our analysis shows that this well-known dependence reflects the influence of two different basic biological properties. One of these is the metabolism-body-size relation of individual that is familiar from physiology. The other less well-recognized property appears as an ecological population factor reflected in the distribution of particle sizes within animal groups in the community and is probably related to the relative sizes and distributions of predators and their prey. It appears that both the physiological and ecological size relationships have to be recognized as scaling factors in order to transform measures of biological production of various parts of communities into common terms for comparison. Current data on the generality and stability of community structure and production suggest that by using this twofold size scaling, trophic energy flow within the community can be determined from the distribution of body sizes without the necessity of specifying trophic levels of the organisms involved. The ecological size scaling can be seen as an index of the system nature of ecosystems.},

  volume = {50},

  abstract = {We investigate specific production rates (per unit biomass) of populations using published data on the relation of annual production/mean biomass (P/B). Aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates between the sizes of copepods and clams are emphasized, ranging about 105\textemdash{}fold in body mass upon reaching maturity (Ms, in kcal to compare with respiratory energy expense) and about 102\textemdash{}fold in P/B. Fishes and mammals are briefly treated; phytoplankton is mentioned. For 33 invertebrates living at annual mean temperatures between about 5\textdegree{} and 20\textdegree{}C, Ms is shown to be an efficient and precise estimator, or scaling factor, of the annual P/B. The rate declines markedly with Ms according to P/B = 0.65Ms\textemdash{}0.37. The exponent differs significantly from the \textemdash{}0.25 power of comparative physiology. Most of the measured values of P/B fall within 50 to 200\% of predicted values. Much of this variability is associated with the ratio of annual production/annual respiration (P/R): for a given Ms, species achieving about half the predicted P/B have P/R ratios of about 0.1; those achieving twice the predicted P/B have P/R ratios of about 1.0. Age upon reaching maturity contributes some variability, with late\textemdash{}maturing ({$>$}1 yr) species tending towards a higher P/B. The variability is not significantly correlated with phylogenetic relationships (excepting insects for which P/B might not be mass\textemdash{}dependent), trophic type, major habitat, production rate, or biomass of the populations. The values of P/B of invertebrates living at annual mean temperatures {$>$}25\textdegree{} may be elevated over those of temperate species of the same Ms, while those of polar forms are depressed. The reasons for a single power function governing the mass dependence of P/B of temperate invertebrates, and for the particular exponent, are unclear; an ecological cause, i.e., mortality, combining with the general size dependence of life processes, is implicated. On the average, the annual specific mortality rate equals P/B and hence also declines by 0.65Ms\textemdash{}0.37. Very small metazoans (pelagic rotifers, benthic meiofauna) tend to have an appreciably lower P/B than indicated by the relationship for larger invertebrates. A refuge from predation by being small is postulated which may also apply for phytoplankton. For meiofauna, a power function of mass dependence of P/B with average rates 3\textemdash{}5 times below those of the larger invertebrates is suggested. Annual P/B values of fishes and mammals likewise decline by a power function of Ms; the few available data yield exponents of \textemdash{}0.26 and \textemdash{}0.33, respectively. Ecological reasons are again invoked. Values of P/B and the specific mortality rates of temperate fishes seem to be 4\textemdash{}5 times, and those of mammals 20\textemdash{}25 times, higher than those of temperate invertebrates of the same mass.},

Here we suggest that this development opens up a new perspective, providing advances ranging from the applied to the theoretical. First, it yields a framework to be applied in specific cases for assessing the extinction risk of community modules in the face of environmental change. Second, it can be used to determine trait combinations allowing for coexistence that is robust to environmental variation, and limits to diversity in the presence of environmental variation, for specific community types. Third, it offers general insights into the nature of communities that are robust to environmental variation. We apply recent community-level extensions of mathematical sensitivity analysis to example models for illustration. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the method, and some of the empirical questions the theoretical framework could help answer.},

Here we use a combination of analytical and empirical approaches to quantify the influence of network architecture on the number of coexisting species. As a case study we consider mutualistic networks between plants and their animal pollinators or seed dispersers. These networks have been found to be highly nested, with the more specialist species interacting only with proper subsets of the species that interact with the more generalist. We show that nestedness reduces effective interspecific competition and enhances the number of coexisting species. Furthermore, we show that a nested network will naturally emerge if new species are more likely to enter the community where they have minimal competitive load. Nested networks seem to occur in many biological and social contexts, suggesting that our results are relevant in a wide range of fields.},

This result leaves us in the uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and stability is warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions. Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems. Our results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.},

The ability of ecological communities to recover after a small perturbation of the species abundances (local asymptotic stability) has been well studied, whereas the likelihood of a community to persist when the interactions are altered (structural stability) has received much less attention. Our goal is to understand the effects of diversity, interaction strenghts and ecological network structure on the volume of parameter space leading to feasible equilibria, i.e., ones in which all populations have positive abundances. We develop a geometrical framework to study the range of conditions necessary for feasible coexistence in both mutualistic and consumer-resource systems. Using analytical and numerical methods, we show that feasibility is determined by just a handful of quantities describing the interactions, yielding a nontrivial complexity-feasibility relationship. Analyzing more than 100 empirical networks, we show that the range of coexistence conditions in mutualistic systems can be analytically predicted by means of a null model of random interactions, whereas food webs are characterized by smaller coexistence domains than those expected by chance. Finally, we characterize the geometric shape of the feasibility domain, thereby identifying the direction of perturbations that are more likely to cause extinctions. Interestingly, the structure of mutualistic interactions leads to very heterogeneous responses to perturbations, making those systems more fragile than expected by chance.},

Its two aspects are how seasonal variation contributes to coexistence mechanisms, and, given a seasonally varying coexistence pattern, how sensitive that coexistence is to nonstationary external influences (such as climate change). Here we develop a formula for calculating the robustness of discrete-time periodic dynamics. Robustness is defined as the sensitivity of the position of the cycle in phase space to varying model parameters. Though the results are different, the main biological conclusions are in line with those from a similar study concerning continuous-time cycles (Barab{\'a}s et al., 2012a): species segregation in the timing of resource use or predator avoidance increases community robustness in a way that is analogous to the effects of resource partitioning. We also connect this formalism with the widely used and successful framework of Chesson (1994), demonstrating that the merging of these two perspectives yields simplified expressions for robustness more amenable to analytical treatment. As an example, we apply our results to a two-cycle in a model of two competing annual plants with seedbanks, using our formulas to calculate the range of parameters that allow for the coexistence of the competitors. This helps us understand which components of the environmental variation the coexistence is sensitive to; in our case, the model is fairly robust against changing seed survival, moderately so against changing the variance in seed germination, and quite sensitive to changing the mean seed germination rates.},

More recently there have been extensions to the sensitivity of nonlinear models, and to communities of interacting populations. Here we derive a fully general mathematical expression for the sensitivity of equilibrium abundances in communities of interacting structured populations. Our method yields the response of an arbitrary function of the stage class abundances to perturbations of any model parameters. As a demonstration, we apply this sensitivity analysis to a two-species model of ontogenetic niche shift where each species has two stage classes, juveniles and adults. In the context of this model, we demonstrate that our theory is quite robust to violating two of its technical assumptions: the assumption that the community is at a point equilibrium and the assumption of infinitesimally small parameter perturbations. Our results on the sensitivity of a community are also interpreted in a niche theoretical context: we determine how the niche of a structured population is composed of the niches of the individual states, and how the sensitivity of the community depends on niche segregation.},

Abstract
Body-size structure of food webs and adaptive foraging of consumers are two of the dominant concepts of our understanding how natural ecosystems maintain their stability and diversity. The interplay of these two processes, however, is a critically important yet unresolved issue. To fill this gap in our knowledge of ecosystem stability, we investigate dynamic random and niche model food webs to evaluate the proportion of persistent species. We show that stronger body-size structures and faster adaptation stabilise these food webs. Body-size structures yield stabilising configurations of interaction strength distributions across food webs, and adaptive foraging emphasises links to resources closer to the base. Moreover, both mechanisms combined have a cumulative effect. Most importantly, unstructured random webs evolve via adaptive foraging into stable size-structured food webs. This offers a mechanistic explanation of how size structure adaptively emerges in complex food webs, thus building a novel bridge between these two important stabilising mechanisms.},

  abstract = {* Ecological communities are composed of populations connected in tangled networks of ecological interactions. Therefore, the extinction of a species can reverberate through the network and cause other (possibly distantly connected) species to go extinct as well. The study of these secondary extinctions is a fertile area of research in ecological network theory.

* However, to facilitate practical applications, several improvements to the current analytical approaches are needed. In particular, we need to consider that (i) species have different `a priori' probabilities of extinction, (ii) disturbances can simultaneously affect several species, and (iii) extinction risk of consumers likely grows with resource loss. All these points can be included in dynamical models, which are, however, difficult to parameterize.

* Here we advance the study of secondary extinctions with Bayesian networks. We show how this approach can account for different extinction responses using binary \textendash{} where each resource has the same importance \textendash{} and quantitative data \textendash{} where resources are weighted by their importance. We simulate ecological networks using a popular dynamical model (the Allometric Trophic Network model) and use it to test our method.

* We find that the Bayesian network model captures the majority of the secondary extinctions produced by the dynamical model and that consumers' responses to species loss are best modelled using a nonlinear sigmoid function. We also show that an approach based exclusively on food web structure loses power when species at higher trophic levels are preferentially lost. Because the loss of apex predators is unfortunately widespread, the results highlight a serious limitation of studies on network robustness.},

  abstract = {We assessed the importance of temperature, salinity, and predation for the size structure of zooplankton and provided insight into the future ecological structure and function of shallow lakes in a warmer climate. Artificial plants were introduced in eight comparable coastal shallow brackish lakes located at two contrasting temperatures: cold-temperate and Mediterranean climate region. Zooplankton, fish, and macroinvertebrates were sampled within the plants and at open-water habitats. The fish communities of these brackish lakes were characterized by small-sized individuals, highly associated with submerged plants. Overall, higher densities of small planktivorous fish were recorded in the Mediterranean compared to the cold-temperate region, likely reflecting temperature-related differences as have been observed in freshwater lakes. Our results suggest that fish predation is the major control of zooplankton size structure in brackish lakes, since fish density was related to a decrease in mean body size and density of zooplankton and this was reflected in a unimodal shaped biomass-size spectrum with dominance of small sizes and low size diversity. Salinity might play a more indirect role by shaping zooplankton communities toward more salt-tolerant species. In a global-warming perspective, these results suggest that changes in the trophic structure of shallow lakes in temperate regions might be expected as a result of the warmer temperatures and the potentially associated increases in salinity. The decrease in the density of large-bodied zooplankton might reduce the grazing on phytoplankton and thus the chances of maintaining the clear water state in these ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The dictionary definition of a law is: "Generalized formulation based on a series of events or processes observed to recur regularly under certain conditions; a widely observable tendency". I argue that ecology has numerous laws in this sense of the word, in the form of widespread, repeatable patterns in nature, but hardly any laws that are universally true. Typically, in other words, ecological patterns and the laws, rules and mechanisms that underpin them are contingent on the organisms involved, and their environment. This contingency is manageable at a relatively simple level of ecological organisation (for example the population dynamics of single and small numbers of species), and re-emerges also in a manageable form in large sets of species, over large spatial scales, or over long time periods, in the form of detail-free statistical patterns - recently called 'macroecology'. The contingency becomes overwhelmingly complicated at intermediate scales, characteristic of community ecology, where there are a large number of case histories, and very little other than weak, fuzzy generalisations. These arguments are illustrated by focusing on examples of typical studies in community ecology, and by way of contrast, on the macroecological relationship that emerges between local species richness and the size of the regional pool of species. The emergent pattern illustrated by local vs regional richness plots is extremely simple, despite the vast number of contingent processes and interactions involved in its generation. To discover general patterns, laws and rules in nature, ecology may need to pay less attention to the 'middle ground' of community ecology, relying less on reductionism and experimental manipulation, but increasing research efforts into macroecology.},

Earlier attempts to understand the mechanism(s) and constraints that govern genome remodeling suffered from being too narrowly focused, and failed to provide a unified and encompassing view of how genomes are organized and regulated inside cells. Here, we propose a new multidisciplinary Integrative Breakage Model for the study of genome evolution. The analysis of the high-level structural organization of genomes (nucleome), together with the functional constrains that accompany genome reshuffling, provide insights into the origin and plasticity of genome organization that may assist with the detection and isolation of therapeutic targets for the treatment of complex human disorders.},

  abstract = {Bacteria and archaea typically possess small genomes that are tightly packed with protein-coding genes. The compactness of prokaryotic genomes is commonly perceived as evidence of adaptive genome streamlining caused by strong purifying selection in large microbial populations. In such populations, even the small cost incurred by nonfunctional DNA because of extra energy and time expenditure is thought to be sufficient for this extra genetic material to be eliminated by selection. However, contrary to the predictions of this model, there exists a consistent, positive correlation between the strength of selection at the protein sequence level, measured as the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates, and microbial genome size. Here, by fitting the genome size distributions in multiple groups of prokaryotes to predictions of mathematical models of population evolution, we show that only models in which acquisition of additional genes is, on average, slightly beneficial yield a good fit to genomic data. These results suggest that the number of genes in prokaryotic genomes reflects the equilibrium between the benefit of additional genes that diminishes as the genome grows and deletion bias (i.e., the rate of deletion of genetic material being slightly greater than the rate of acquisition). Thus, new genes acquired by microbial genomes, on average, appear to be adaptive. The tight spacing of protein-coding genes likely results from a combination of the deletion bias and purifying selection that efficiently eliminates nonfunctional, noncoding sequences.},

Here, we critically evaluate the prospects of ecological neutral theory (ENT), a popular model in ecology, as it applies at the genomic level. This assessment requires an overview of the controversy surrounding neutral models in community ecology. In particular, we discuss the limitations of using ENT both as an explanation of community dynamics and as a null hypothesis. We then analyse a case study in which ENT has been applied to genomic data. Our central finding is that genetic elements do not conform to the requirements of ENT once its assumptions and limitations are made explicit. We further compare this genome-level application of ENT to two other, more familiar approaches in genomics that rely on neutral mechanisms: Kimura's molecular neutral theory and Lynch's mutational-hazard model. Interestingly, this comparison reveals that there are two distinct concepts of neutrality associated with these models, which we dub `fitness neutrality' and `competitive neutrality'. This distinction helps to clarify the various roles for neutral models in genomics, for example in explaining the evolution of genome size.},

According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection.

Deep sequencing now provides detailed snapshots of ribosome occupancy on mRNAs. We leverage these data to parameterize a computational model of translation, keeping track of every ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA molecule in a yeast cell. We determine the parameter regimes in which fast initiation or high codon bias in a transgene increases protein yield and infer the initiation rates of endogenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, which vary by several orders of magnitude and correlate with 5{${'}$} mRNA folding energies. Our model recapitulates the previously reported 5{${'}$}-to-3{${'}$} ramp of decreasing ribosome densities, although our analysis shows that this ramp is caused by rapid initiation of short genes rather than slow codons at the start of transcripts. We conclude that protein production in healthy yeast cells is typically limited by the availability of free ribosomes, whereas protein production under periods of stress can sometimes be rescued by reducing initiation or elongation rates.},

Testing for similarities and differences between the sexes is important not only for clinical assessment but also has implications for theories of typical sex differences and of autism. Using cognitive and behavioral measures, we investigated similarities and differences between the sexes in age- and IQ-matched adults with ASC (high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome). Of the 83 (45 males and 38 females) participants, 62 (33 males and 29 females) met Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) cut-off criteria for autism in childhood and were included in all subsequent analyses. The severity of childhood core autism symptoms did not differ between the sexes. Males and females also did not differ in self-reported empathy, systemizing, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive traits/symptoms or mentalizing performance. However, adult females with ASC showed more lifetime sensory symptoms (p = 0.036), fewer current socio-communication difficulties (p = 0.001), and more self-reported autistic traits (p = 0.012) than males. In addition, females with ASC who also had developmental language delay had lower current performance IQ than those without developmental language delay (p{$<$}0.001), a pattern not seen in males. The absence of typical sex differences in empathizing-systemizing profiles within the autism spectrum confirms a prediction from the extreme male brain theory. Behavioral sex differences within ASC may also reflect different developmental mechanisms between males and females with ASC. We discuss the importance of the superficially better socio-communication ability in adult females with ASC in terms of why females with ASC may more often go under-recognized, and receive their diagnosis later, than males.},

Method
The recently revised algorithm and severity scores for Module 4 were used to analyze predictive values compared to the original algorithm in a sample of N = 356, 21\% females, age range 12\textendash{}68 yrs.
Results
Both algorithms have good sensitivity and specificity, with slightly better results for the revised algorithm. Diagnostic accuracy is lower for females, older individuals, and individuals with personality disorders or higher intellectual abilities.
Conclusion
The revised algorithm has good utility when used as part of a comprehensive assessment procedure conducted by an experienced examiner and including information on developmental history.},

  abstract = {The study of the distribution of biomass by size provides an ataxonomic approach for analyzing the structure of the pelagic ecosystem. However, empirical data regarding planktonic size-structure in offshore areas are scarce. Here, we report the results of a study of the planktonic biomass size-distribution at several stations located within two regions (Sargasso Sea and New England Seamounts Area) of the Northwest Atlantic. The biomass size-spectra covered a body-size range from bacteria to mesozooplankton and a depth range from the surface to 400 m. It is shown that the slope of the normalized biomass size-spectrum (NBS-spectrum) varies depending on whether volume or carbon units are used. The transformation from volume to carbon units makes the slope of the NBS-spectrum approximately 0.15 units more negative. The distribution of normalized-biomass by size was linear (plotted on a log\textendash{}log scale) at all stations. The slopes of the NBS-spectra (volume scale) ranged from -0.96 to -1.01. There were no significant differences among the slopes of the NBS-spectra within either of the two areas studied. In addition, no significant differences were detected between the stations in the Sargasso Sea and those located in the New England Seamounts area. Apart from a tendency towards a decrease in the intercept of the normalized-biomass axis of the size-spectra in deeper waters, the NBS-spectra were also very similar through depth. The slopes of the NBS-spectra in biovolume units are not significantly different from -1.0 (p\&lt;0.01), and therefore are in agreement with Sheldon's Linear Biomass Hypothesis. By contrast, the slopes of the NBS-spectra in carbon units are significantly different (p\&lt;0.01) from -1.0 (range=\textendash{}1.09 to \textendash{}1.17; all stations together=\textendash{}1.14) and their numerical values are in close agreement with Platt and Denman's model and with the findings of Rodr{\'i}guez and Mullin, 1986a) for the North Pacific Central Gyre.

  abstract = {Climate change and resource exploitation have been shown to modify the importance of bottom-up and top-down forces in ecosystems. However, the resulting pattern of trophic control in complex food webs is an emergent property of the system and thus unintuitive. We develop a statistical nondeterministic model, capable of modeling complex patterns of trophic control for the heavily impacted North Sea ecosystem. The model is driven solely by fishing mortality and climatic variables and based on time-series data covering {$>$}40 y for six plankton and eight fish groups along with one bird group ({$>$}20 y). Simulations show the outstanding importance of top-down exploitation pressure for the dynamics of fish populations. Whereas fishing effects on predators indirectly altered plankton abundance, bottom-up climatic processes dominate plankton dynamics. Importantly, we show planktivorous fish to have a central role in the North Sea food web initiating complex cascading effects across and between trophic levels. Our linked model integrates bottom-up and top-down effects and is able to simulate complex long-term changes in ecosystem components under a combination of stressor scenarios. Our results suggest that in marine ecosystems, pathways for bottom-up and top-down forces are not necessarily mutually exclusive and together can lead to the emergence of complex patterns of control.},

In this paper we use regression analysis to examine the relationship of growing season mean chlorophyll a concentration with total phosphorus and total nitrogen using summary data from over 1,000 European lakes. For analysis, lakes were grouped into types with three categories of mean depth, alkalinity and humic content. The lakes were also divided into broad geographic regions covering Atlantic, Northern, Central/Baltic and for some types the Mediterranean areas of Europe. Chlorophyll a was found to be significantly related to both total phosphorus and total nitrogen, although total phosphorus was almost always found to be the best predictor of chlorophyll. Different nutrient chlorophyll relationships were found for lakes according to mean depth and alkalinity, although no significant effect of geographic region or humic content was found for the majority of lake types. We identified three groups of lakes with significantly different responses. Deep lakes had the lowest yield of chlorophyll per unit of nutrient, low and moderate alkalinity shallow lakes the highest and high alkalinity lakes were intermediate. We recommend that the regression models provided for these three lake groups should be used for lake management in Europe and discuss the limitations of such models.},

There is also a shift from viewing assemblages in terms of their contribution to particular processes toward placing them within a wider food web context. We review how the responses and predictors in B-EF experiments are quantified and how biodiversity effects are shaped by multitrophic interactions. Further, we discuss how B-EF metrics and food web relations could be addressed simultaneously.

  abstract = {Ecosystems can alternate suddenly between contrasting persistent states due to internal processes or external drivers. It is important to understand the mechanisms by which these shifts occur, especially in exploited ecosystems. There have been several abrupt marine ecosystem shifts attributed either to fishing, recent climate change or a combination of these two drivers. We show that temperature has been an important driver of the trophodynamics of the North Sea, a heavily fished marine ecosystem, for nearly 50 years and that a recent pronounced change in temperature established a new ecosystem dynamic regime through a series of internal mechanisms. Using an end-to-end ecosystem approach that included primary producers, primary, secondary and tertiary consumers, and detritivores, we found that temperature modified the relationships among species through nonlinearities in the ecosystem involving ecological thresholds and trophic amplifications. Trophic amplification provides an alternative mechanism to positive feedback to drive an ecosystem towards a new dynamic regime, which in this case favours jellyfish in the plankton and decapods and detritivores in the benthos. Although overfishing is often held responsible for marine ecosystem degeneration, temperature can clearly bring about similar effects. Our results are relevant to ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), seen as the way forward to manage exploited marine ecosystems.},

even-numbered food chains enhance emissions. Here, we report experiments in three-tier food chains in experimental ponds, streams and bromeliads in Canada and Costa Rica in the presence or absence of fish
(Gasterosteus aculeatus) and invertebrate (Hesperoperla pacifica and Mecistogaster modesta) predators. We monitored carbon dioxide fluxes along with prey and primary producer biomass. We found substantially reduced carbon dioxide emissions in the presence of predators in all systems, despite differences in predator type, hydrology, climatic region, ecological zone and level of in situ primary production. We also observed lower amounts of prey biomass and higher amounts of algal and detrital biomass in the presence of predators. We conclude that

We present a detailed review that builds on earlier work by including the most recent literature, and is more extensive than previous comparative frameworks. Solar radiation management propsals are most effective but short-lived, whilst carbon dioxide removal measures gain effectiveness the longer they are pursued. Solar radiation management could restore the global radiative balance, but must be maintained to avoid abrupt warming, meanwhile ocean acidification and residual regional climate changes would still occur. Carbon dioxide removal involves less risk, and offers a way to return to a pre-industrial CO2 level and climate on a millennial timescale, but is potentially limited by the CO2 storage capacity of geological reservoirs. Geoengineering could complement mitigation, but it is not an alternative to it. We expand on the possible combinations of mitigation, carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management that might be used to avoid dangerous climate change.},

  issn = {0142-7873},
  abstract = {A simple system of parametrically forced ordinary differential equations is used to model autumn phytoplankton blooms in temperate oceans by a mechanism involving deepening of the upper mixed layer. Blooms are triggered provided the increase in nutrients in the mixed layer is rapid within the first few days of deepening and provided light-limited phytoplankton growth rate is relatively high. Blooms exist as transient trajectories between quasi-equilibrium states, rather than as bifurcations of steady states; therefore very gradual deepening cannot trigger blooms. Very rapid deepening also prevents blooms due to the deleterious effect on phytoplankton growth rate. The mechanisms identified by this simple model are vindicated by considering alternative grazing and deepening regimes and by comparison with a more ecologically complex model (Fasham, 1993, in The Global Carbon Cycle, Springer-Verlag). Modelled estimates of primary productivity from both the simple model and the complex model parameterized for Ocean Weather Station `India' are around 0.5 g C m-2 day-1 during the autumn bloom, therefore comprising a significant component of annual production in temperate areas.},

The maximum uptake rate of nitrate was well correlated with the uptake of inorganic carbon; these two rates expressed on a chlorophyll a basis were relatively lower at higher latitude stations. Maximum uptake rates of ammonium and urea clearly covaried with the ambient water temperature. The estimated turnover times of ammonium at subtropical and tropical stations ranged from 1 to 3 days.

The size-abundance distribution was dominated by medium-sized phytoplankton cells (Gymnodinium cf. excavatum, Tetraselmis apiculata, Dunaliella spp. and several diatom species), large ciliates (Fabrea salina) and a few zooplankton species adapted to changing temporary environments within a wide size range (Cletocamptus retrogressus, Moina salina, Branchinella spinosa). This polymodal size distribution is compared with results obtained in other systems, including small physically controlled lakes, large lakes, oceans and marine benthos. Consideration of the size structure within homogeneous groups of organisms shows slopes less negative than the average for the whole size range analysed, a feature which is common in small and physically controlled ecosystems. A seasonal study of the size structure revealed uneven distributions throughout the year, resulting in discontinuities in the size spectra as well as in differences of total size range. There were noticeable differences among the size spectra at each particular time, showing phases of primary producer predominance and phases with a marked predominance of consumers. The time-integrated size spectrum did not exhibit any distinct discontinuity. The influence of extreme shallowness and resuspension on the shape and dynamics of the size spectrum is examined and discussed compared to deeper aquatic systems.},

  abstract = {In meso-eutrophic Lake Constance (Germany-Austria-Switzerland), phytoplankton bioraass, pigments and water transparency, as well as primary productivity, have been followed between 1980 and 1989. During this period, municipal phosphorus loading declined significantly. Since 1981, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations during deep lake mixing have decreased from {$\sim$}3.0 to currently 1 6 mmol m -3 at a rate of 7\% year -1 . Nitrate concentrations, by contrast, continued to rise. During the period of maximum phosphorus loading, flushing through the outlet and sedimentation were about equally important sinks of phosphorus from the euphotic zone. Recently, however, sedimentation and subsequent burial of P in the bottom deposits contributed about three-quarters to the overall P-losses from the system Main reasons for this shift are unchanged settling fluxes of phosphorus out of the euphotic zone and decreasing concentrations of total phosphorus in the water.  Only during spring, do concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus within the euphotic zone decrease in proportion to the formation of particulate organic matter. Later during the season, euphotic SRP concentrations continue to be low but are no longer matched by high plankton biomass because phosphorus is efficiently removed by settling of particles In spite of the observed dramatic decrease in phosphorus loading since 1980, chlorophyll concentrations and water transparency, as well as annual phytoplankton productivity ({$\sim$}300 g C m -2 ), have not shown a consistent downward trend. However, the intensity of phosphorus regeneration within the euphoric zone, which can be used as a measure of the degree of nutrient limitation, is likely to have increased significantly The most probable explanation for the insensitivity of important trophic state indicators to reduced nutrient loading is that, in Lake Constance, biomass accumulation to a greater extent is controlled by losses, mainly grazing by zooplankton and sedimentation, than by primary resources. This is concluded from the observation that phytoplankton biomass always falls far short of the nutrient-dependent carrying capacity of the system.},

  shorttitle = {Great {{Lakes}} Total Phosphorus Revisited},
  abstract = {Mass balance models are used to simulate chloride and total phosphorus (TP) trends from 1800 to the present for the North American Great Lakes. The chloride mass balance is employed to estimate turbulent eddy diffusion between model segments. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations are then simulated based on estimated historical and measured TP loading time series. Up until about 1990, simulation results for all parts of the system generally conform to measured TP concentrations and exhibit significant improvement due primarily to load reductions from the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. After 1990, the model simulations diverge from observed data for the offshore waters of all the lakes except Lake Superior with the observations suggesting a greater improvement than predicted by the model. The largest divergence occurs in Lake Ontario where the model predicts that load reductions should bring the lake to oligo-mesotrophic levels, whereas the data indicate that it is solidly oligotrophic and seems to be approaching an ultra-oligotrophic state. Less dramatic divergences also occur in the offshore waters of lakes Michigan, Huron and Erie. In order to simulate these outcomes, the model's apparent settling velocity, which parameterizes the rate that total phosphorus is permanently lost to the lake's deep sediments, must be increased significantly after 1990. This result provides circumstantial support for the hypothesis that Dreissenid mussels have enhanced the Great Lakes phosphorus assimilation capacity. Finally, all interlake mass transfers of TP via connecting channels have dropped since phosphorus control measures were implemented beginning in the mid-1970s.},

  abstract = {Using an in situ approach, we have evaluated the phosphorus inputs from zooplankton in a high-mountain oligotrophic lake. Values of the specific gross release rate (SGRR) fluctuated between 0.2 and 2.9 {$\mu$}g P mg -1 dry weight h -1 , and were higher when the nauplii of Mixodiaptomus laciniatus dominated the zooplankton community. The rate of P recycling by the zooplankton was high, reaching 1.6 {$\mu$}g P l -1 day -1 , and showed a highly consistent seasonal pattern from one year to the next, with maxima in midsummer. Zooplankton size accounted for as much as 85\% of the variance obtained in the measurements of the specific rate of P release, while other factors, such as the quality or quantity of food, did not significantly influence the SGRR changes. Among the models tested, only the one proposed by Peters ( Int, Ver. Theor. Angew. Limnol. Verh ., 19, 273\textendash{}279, 1975) was useful for predictions in this system. The stoichiometric model of Hessen and Andersen ( Arch. Hydrobiol ., 35, 111\textendash{}120, 1992), applied in this oligotrophic system, adequately predicted the phyto- and zooplankton dynamics, whereas the values of P release estimated using this model were far higher than the excretion rates obtained experimentally. These differences were related to the type of egestion (formation of faecal pellets) of metazooplankton and to the relative importance of the food resistance to digestion. We believe that in communities where copepods constitute a substantial percentage of the zooplankton, an evaluation of the P release which is readily available [soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), total dissolved phosphate (TDP)] to algae and bacteria would not fit the predictions of general models of mass balance; under these circumstances, assimilation efficiency proves to be the key parameter for predicting the readily available P (excreted P).},

The photosynthetic parameters, Pm (the light saturated rate) and {$\alpha$} (the light limited slope), varied significantly among seasons and were highly positively correlated, with lowest values in the DSS and highest values in WSS. During deep mixing, Pm did not covary with {$\alpha$}; and the light saturation index, Ek (=Pbm/{$\alpha$}), varied in response to changes in {$\alpha$} rather than in Pm. Phytoplankton appeared to be nutrient deficient at all times but less deficient during deep vertical mixing in the DMS. Average daily rates of integrated phytoplankton primary productivity were lowest in the DSS (337 mg C m d) and highest in the WSS (629 mg C m d) despite nearly identical mean chlorophyll concentrations. Along a near shore transect off the Linthipe River, chlorophyll concentrations were higher and more variable (1.4 {$\pm$} 1.3 {$\mu$}g L), phytoplankton were not strongly nutrient deficient and chlorophyll specific photosynthetic activity was as high or higher than at the offshore station.

The lake was sampled monthly during a relatively rainy year (1987\textendash{}88, 10.5 months permanence). The result of combined analyses for environmental variables (salinity, temperature and soluble inorganic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus), variables related to biological activity (chlorophyll `a', sediment organic matter and redox potential) and the direct analysis of the planktonic community, shows the existence of two periods of dominance by autotrophs. The first occurs during winter, exhibits a progressively higher surface to volume ratio for phytoplankton and is followed in the spring by high zooplankton densities (Moina salina, Fabrea salina) and very low phytoplankton densities, suggesting the existence of a period with a detritus-based food web. The summer period coincides with a community better adapted to high salinities that is dominated by Dunaliella salina, D. viridis, diatoms and the ciliate Fabrea salina, and associated with high ammonium concentrations. A new period of organic matter accumulation could be facilitated, in the last moments before the lake dries, by a progressive decrease in zooplankton abundance.},

  abstract = {SummarySpecies body size distributions from eight temperate benthic communities show a highly conservative pattern with two separate lognormal distributions, corresponding to the traditional categories of meiofauna and macrofauna. The meiofaunal mode occurs at a dry body weight of 0.64 {$\mu$}g and the macrofaunal mode at 3.2 mg, with a trough between them at 45 {$\mu$}g. It is suggested that there is a particular body size at which meiofaunal life-history and feeding traits can be optimised, and another for macrofaunal traits. As size departs in either direction (larger or smaller) from these optima, fewer species of the same size are able to co-exist. The split occurs at 45 {$\mu$}g because many life history and feeding characteristics switch more or less abruptly at about this body size, compromise traits being either non-viable or disadvantageous. Meiofauna and macrofauna therefore comprise two separate evolutionary units each with an internally coherent set of biological characteristics.The expression of this conservative pattern is modified by water depth: the proportion of macrofauna species increases from intertidal situations to deeper water, and it is suggested that mechanisms of resource partitioning and diversity maintainence in the meiofauna and macrofauna are affected differentially by sediment disturbance. Salinity does not affect this proportionality, and so does not differentially affect mechanisms for maintaining species diversity in any particular size category of animals. Meiofauna species size distributions may be modified in sandy sediments because of physical impositions on interstitial or burrowing lifestyles.Brief discussion of some implications of these observations includes speculations on the larval ecology of macrofauna, on gigantism in Antarctic invertebrates, and on the benthic Sheldon spectrum.},

Structurally uniform groups of animals such as the Odonata do not show this distribution, but in mammal faunas it is approached.

  abstract = {Abstract The biological diversity, including the marine one, and its advanced and continuous decline, respectively, range among priority issues at planetary level, y compris the Black Sea, nowadays. As to the Black Sea and its biodiversity, among the other concerns on present ecological disequilibrium, pollution, living resources, the problem consists of its five times larger watershed than the sea surface itself, totalizing about 350 km3 of freshwater, originating in the hydrographic basins of the Danube, Dneper, Dnester and Don, each year. The six Black Sea coastal states Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russian Federation and Turkey themselves affect marine biodiversity directly through their land-based pollution sources. This review reveals the present state and evolution trends of Black Sea macrophytobenthos, zoobenthos, phytoplankton and related blooms, zooplankton, ichtyofauna and cetaceans, with some examples of changes occurring in the Romanian coastal and marine ecosystem during the last seven decades. The main conclusions highlight that the Black Sea ecosystem is different from that documented in the former reference periods, a slight improvement and rehabilitation tendency of the ecosystem since 1995, the considerable improvement of the pelagic ecosystem especially due to weakening of anthropic pressure. But it is still out of balance by its biodiversity and fish stocks due to eutrophication, overfishing and alien species invasion. The long lasting processes of ecosystem restoration, of qualitative improvement of environmental factors and of fishery resources depend on the efficiency of conservation, protection and management measures to be undertaken together by Danube riparian countries and Black Sea coastal states. There is still a strong need for continuing regional co-operation in the fields of monitoring, research and legislation, by developing scientifically sound data bases and communication networks, for decision makers and end-users.},

These experimental observations were necessary to refine the dynamic carbon budget presented as a simulation model in another report. The ratio of carbon biomass to dry weight may vary several-fold depending on the nutritional state and size from \&gt;12\% in well-fed larvae to \&lt;1\% in starved adults. Feeding effort (clearance rate) is higher for previously starved animals, falling sharply within a few hours after re-exposure to food. Direct visual observations of feeding activity of animals confirmed this. Assimilation efficiency can be high (72\%) in these animals but if they continue to feed at high food concentrations, incoming food displaces material which is only partially digested and assimilation efficiency decreases substantially. Except at very low food concentrations, growth efficiency ranges between 20 and 45\%. Mnemiopsis , begins to produce eggs at a size much less than its maximum. Egg production is very sensitive to food supply, and somatic growth is favored over egg production at low food densities. Even though several thousand eggs may be produced over a few days, they represent \&lt;2\% day -1 of the carbon biomass of the ctenophore and several-fold less than respiratory carbon.},

Some features of cyanobacteria can be regarded as anti-herbivore defences. Large colonies of Aphanizomenon, Anabaena and Microcystis cannot be handled by zooplankton, but do not interfere seriously with the filtering process. Small colonies and filaments, however, may cause severe inhibition of the feeding process by mechanical interference. This reduces zooplankton growth, reproduction, and survival. Copepods, rotifers, and Bosmina are less affected by mechanical disturbance than cladocerans. If ingested, some cyanobacteria may be poorly digested or may not provide essential nutrients. Some cyanobacteria are reported to be toxic to zooplankton. Several strains of Microcystis produce an endotoxin, but the amount of toxin produced differs among strains and with the condition of Microcystis. Zooplankton encountering toxic cells cease feeding. Some evidence of an extra-cellular herbivore deterrent was found for Anabaena. Thus, cyanobacteria may either be individually protected or may create an environment that is unfavourable for efficient grazers (e.g., Daphnia).},

Here, we examine the mass scaling of respiration and maximum feeding (clearance and ingestion rates) and growth rates of heterotrophic pelagic organisms over an {$\sim$}1015 range in body mass. We show that clearance and respiration rates have life-form-dependent allometries that have similar scaling but different intercepts, such that the mass-specific rates converge on a rather narrow size-independent range. In contrast, ingestion and growth rates follow a near-universal taxa-independent {$\sim$}3/4 mass scaling power law. We argue that the declining mass-specific clearance rates with size within taxa is related to the inherent decrease in feeding efficiency of any particular feeding mode. The transitions between feeding mode and simultaneous transitions in clearance and respiration rates may then represent adaptations to the food environment and be the result of the optimization of trade-offs that allow sufficient feeding and growth rates to balance mortality.},

the oxytactic
bacterium Bacillus subtilis is placed in a chamber with its upper

swim upwards (up an oxygen gradient) on average. This results in an unstable
density
distribution and an overturning instability. The pattern formation is dependent
on
depth and experiments in a tilted chamber have shown that as the depth
increases
the first patterns formed are hexagons in which the fluid flows down in
the centre.The linear stability of this system was analysed by Hillesdon \&
Pedley (1996) who
found that the system is unstable if the Rayleigh number {$\Gamma$}
exceeds a critical value,
which depends on the wavenumber k of the disturbance as well as
on the values of
other parameters. Hillesdon \& Pedley found that the
critical wavenumber kc could be
either zero or non-zero, depending on the parameter values.In this paper we carry out a weakly nonlinear analysis to determine
the relative
stability of hexagon and roll patterns formed at the onset of bioconvection.
The
analysis is different in the two cases kc{$\not =$}0
and kc=0. For the
kc{$\not =$}0 case (which
appears to be more relevant experimentally) the model does predict down
hexagons,
but only for a certain range of parameter values. Hence the analysis allows
us to refine
previous parameter estimates. For the kc=0

analysis and derive an equation describing the evolution of the horizontal

All possible local bifurcation diagrams (assuming certain non-degeneracy conditions) are found using only group theory. The results are therefore applicable to other systems with the same symmetries. Rolls, hexagons, or a new solution, regular triangles, can be stable depending on the physical system. Rolls are stable in ordinary Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection. The results are compared to those of Buzano and Golubitsky [1] without the midplane reflection symmetry. The bifurcation behavior of the two cases is quite different, and a connection between them is established by considering the effects of breaking the reflectional symmetry. Finally, the relevant experimental results are described.},

  abstract = {The reproductive success of periodical cicadas, measured as the number of offspring produced per adult, is found to increase as adult density increases. The inverse density\textemdash{}dependent pattern at the adult stage occurred over the entire range of adult densities encountered. This result could have been caused by (1) predator satiation, (2) increased fecundity at higher densities, (3) more efficient mating at higher densities, and (4) movement of adults from sites of low initial densities to sites of high densities. The hypothesis of predator satiation was explored in depth. Predation at each site was crudely estimated by collecting cicada wings, which are discarded by avian predators. If predator satiation accounts for the inverse density\textemdash{}dependent mortality, then each cicada's risk of capture will decrease as cicada density increases. The data suggest that this prediction is true; predation did not increase as cicada density increased so that the probability of escaping predation is greater at high\textemdash{}density sites. Estimated predator densities are independent of cicada densities, which indicates that predators cannot respond numerically to the cicada emergence. As cicada density increases, the number of cicada wings recovered per bird does not significantly increase, suggesting that birds are satiated. Significantly more cicada wings were recovered at sites with more birds. Total cicada predation was independent of cicada density but dependent on the density of predators. Some evolutionary consequences of these results are discussed.},

For a given number of species per functional group, the risk of further extinctions is highest when an autotroph is removed and lowest when a top predator is removed. In addition, stability decreases when the distribution of interaction strengths in the webs is changed from equal to skew (few strong and many weak links).

  title = {Multi-Model Ensembles for Ecosystem Prediction},
  abstract = {When making predictions about ecosystems, we often have available a number of different ecosystem models that attempt to represent their dynamics in a detailed mechanistic way. Each of these can be used as simulators of large-scale experiments and make forecasts about the fate of ecosystems under different scenarios in order to support the development of appropriate management strategies. However, structural differences, systematic discrepancies and uncertainties lead to different models giving different predictions under these scenarios. This is further complicated by the fact that the models may not be run with the same species or functional groups, spatial structure or time scale. Rather than simply trying to select a 'best' model, or taking some weighted average, it is important to exploit the strengths of each of the available models, while learning from the differences between them. To achieve this, we construct a flexible statistical model of the relationships between a collection or 'ensemble' of mechanistic models and their biases, allowing for structural and parameter uncertainty and for different ways of representing reality. Using this statistical meta-model, we can combine prior beliefs, model estimates and direct observations using Bayesian methods, and make coherent predictions of future outcomes under different scenarios with robust measures of uncertainty. In this paper we present the modelling framework and discuss results obtained using a diverse ensemble of models in scenarios involving future changes in fishing levels. These examples illustrate the value of our approach in predicting outcomes for possible strategies pertaining to climate and fisheries policy aimed at improving food security and maintaining ecosystem integrity.},

  abstract = {The size structure of fish-communities is an emergent high-level property of marine food webs responsive to changes in structure and function. To measure this food web property using data arising from routine fisheries surveys, a simple metric known as Typical Length has been proposed as more suitable than the Large Fish Indicator, which has been highly engineered to be responsive to fishing pressure. Typical Length avoids the inherent dependence of the Large Fish Indicator on a parameter that requires case-by-case adjustments. Using IBTS survey time series for five spatial subdivisions of the Greater North Sea, we show that the Typical Length can provide information equivalent to the Large Fish Indicator when fishing is likely the strongest driver, but differences can also arise. In this example, Typical Length exhibits smaller random fluctuations ("noise") than the Large Fish Indicator. Typical Length is also more adaptable than the Large Fish Indicator and can be easily applied to monitor pelagic fish in addition to demersal fish, and together with information on the potential growth of the fish community, a proxy of which can be derived from the Mean Maximum Length indicator, it is possible to partition change in community composition from change in size structure. This suggests that Typical Length is an improvement over the Large Fish Indicator as a food web indicator with the potential to offer further insight when considered in conjunction with indicators of community composition.},

Yet, measuring the structural stability of nonlinear dynamical systems remains a challenging task. Focusing on the classic Lotka-Volterra dynamics, because of the linearity of the functional response, it has been possible to measure the conditions compatible with a structurally stable system. However, the functional response of biological communities is not always well approximated by deterministic linear functions. Thus, it is unclear the extent to which this linear approach can be generalized to other population dynamics models. Here, we show that the same approach used to investigate the classic Lotka-Volterra dynamics, which is called the structural approach, can be applied to a much larger class of nonlinear models. This class covers a large number of nonlinear functional responses that have been intensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally. We also investigate the applicability of the structural approach to stochastic dynamical systems and we provide a measure of structural stability for finite populations. Overall, we show that the structural approach can provide reliable and tractable information about the qualitative behavior of many nonlinear dynamical systems.},

Further analysis reveals that a correlation between the effects of predators on prey and those of prey on predators, combined with a high frequency of weak interactions, stabilize food web dynamics relative to the random expectation. We conclude that empirical food webs have several non-random properties contributing to the absence of a complexity\textendash{}stability relationship.},

  abstract = {A review is made of quantitative estimations on abundance and biomass of nematode faunas from different ecosystems. A great dispersion of the values from different authors is probably to some extent caused by differences in the efficiency of the extraction methods. The mean values of numerical abundance for different types of ecosystems ranged from 7.6{$\cdot$} 10\textsuperscript{5} m\textsuperscript{-2} for semideserts to 9.2{$\cdot$} 10\textsuperscript{6} m\textsuperscript{-2} for temperate grasslands. The respiratory metabolism in more productive sites corresponded to an energy emittance of about 20-60 kcal m\textsuperscript{-2} and year whereas in cold or dry sites it amounted to 7-10 kcal m\textsuperscript{-2} and year. The contribution of nematodes to the total soil respiration is rather slight; probably in many cases under 1\%. The accuracy of estimations on the total energy flow through the soil populations is discussed. Probably the microbial feeders have a high assimilation efficiency whereas the production efficiency is more varying depending upon the food supply which in the soil possibly often is quite scarce.

  abstract = {The normal form of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite, which produces from the same germ-line tissue first a limited number of sperm and then a larger number of oocytes. Self-progeny brood sizes are determined by the number of sperm, and most of the oocytes remain unfertilized. Therefore it might seem selectively advantageous to increase the number of sperm, and hence the size of the brood. A mutation that leads to a 50\% increase in sperm production allows a comparison of population growth rates between the wild type (mean brood 327 progeny) and the mutant (mean brood 499 progeny). Wild-type populations grow faster, as measured by food consumption, indicating that increased brood size is not advantageous. The mutant appears to be at a disadvantage because the additional spermatogenesis leads to a delay in the onset of oogenesis, and hence to an increase in the minimum generation time. In support of the notion of an optimal brood size, it was found that different natural isolates of this species have self-fertilities similar to that of the standard laboratory strain, in the range 250\textemdash{}350 progeny per worm.},

  issn = {0027-8424, 1091-6490},
  abstract = {Spatially embedded complex networks, such as nervous systems, the Internet, and transportation networks, generally have nontrivial topological patterns of connections combined with nearly minimal wiring costs. However, the growth rules shaping these economical tradeoffs between cost and topology are not well understood. Here, we study the cellular nervous system of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, together with information on the birth times of neurons and on their spatial locations. We find that the growth of this network undergoes a transition from an accelerated to a constant increase in the number of links (synaptic connections) as a function of the number of nodes (neurons). The time of this phase transition coincides closely with the observed moment of hatching, when development switches metamorphically from oval to larval stages. We use graph analysis and generative modeling to show that the transition between different growth regimes, as well as its coincidence with the moment of hatching, may be explained by a dynamic economical model that incorporates a tradeoff between topology and cost that is continuously negotiated and renegotiated over developmental time. As the body of the animal progressively elongates, the cost of longer-distance connections is increasingly penalized. This growth process regenerates many aspects of the adult nervous system's organization, including the neuronal membership of anatomically predefined ganglia. We expect that similar economical principles may be found in the development of other biological or manmade spatially embedded complex systems.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 627?642 Abstract A unified theory in science is a theory that shows a common underlying set of rules that regulate processes previously thought to be distinct. Unified theories have been important in physics including the unification of electricity and magnetism and the unification of the electromagnetic with the weak nuclear force. Surprisingly, ecology, specifically the subfields of biodiversity and macroecology, also possess not one but at least six unified theories. This is problematic as only one unified theory is desirable. Superficially, the six unified theories seem very different. However, I show that all six theories use the same three rules or assertions to describe a stochastic geometry of biodiversity. The three rules are: (1) intraspecifically individuals are clumped together; (2) interspecifically global or regional abundance varies according to a hollow curve distribution; and (3) interspecifically individuals are placed without regard to individuals of other species. These three rules appear sufficient to explain local species abundance distributions, species?area relationships, decay of similarity of distance and possibly other patterns of biodiversity. This provides a unification of the unified theories. I explore implications of this unified theory for future research.},

  abstract = {This volume takes a fresh look at climate change as a threat to peace and its impacts on cultural heritage and cultural diversity. It proceeds under the assumption that the impacts of climate change on cultural heritage and cultural diversity may challenge sustainable global peace. As innovative feature, the interdisciplinary nexus between cultural heritage and peace is explicitly taken account of. Accordingly, corresponding threats on climate change and conflict on the one hand, and protection of cultural property and climate change on the other, are pulled together into one conceptual triangle. While the importance of the protection of cultural heritage in armed conflicts tends to become more and more recognized, the crucial role of cultural policy as a reconciliatory, proactive element of building and securing of sustainable peace has so far been largely underestimated. This volume brings together opinions of renowned experts in the fields of international law as well as natural sciences, engineering, humanities and social sciences. The focus lays on the legal and institutional challenges faced by national and international stakeholders, by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in particular. Moreover, it alludes to broader issues of mitigation, adaptation and resilience.},

  abstract = {The Earth's ecosystems are under unprecedented pressure, yet the nature of contemporary biodiversity change is not well understood. Growing evidence that community size is regulated highlights the need for improved understanding of community dynamics. As stability in community size could be underpinned by marked temporal turnover, a key question is the extent to which changes in both biodiversity dimensions (temporal {$\alpha$}- and temporal {$\beta$}-diversity) covary within and among the assemblages that comprise natural communities. Here, we draw on a multiassemblage dataset (encompassing vertebrates, invertebrates, and unicellular plants) from a tropical freshwater ecosystem and employ a cyclic shift randomization to assess whether any directional change in temporal {$\alpha$}-diversity and temporal {$\beta$}-diversity exceeds baseline levels. In the majority of cases, {$\alpha$}-diversity remains stable over the 5-y time frame of our analysis, with little evidence for systematic change at the community level. In contrast, temporal {$\beta$}-diversity changes are more prevalent, and the two diversity dimensions are decoupled at both the within- and among-assemblage level. Consequently, a pressing research challenge is to establish how turnover supports regulation and when elevated temporal {$\beta$}-diversity jeopardizes community integrity.},

Here, we analyse an exceptionally comprehensive 29-year time series of North Atlantic groundfish assemblages monitored over 5\textdegree{} latitude to the west of Scotland. These fish assemblages show no systematic change in species richness through time, but steady change in species composition, leading to an increase in spatial homogenization: the species identity of colder northern localities increasingly resembles that of warmer southern localities. This biotic homogenization mirrors the spatial pattern of unevenly rising ocean temperatures over the same time period suggesting that climate change is primarily responsible for the spatial homogenization we observe. In this and other ecosystems, apparent constancy in species richness may mask major changes in species composition driven by anthropogenic change.},

The paradox of the ``paradox of the plankton''. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 71: 236\textendash{}240.One of the central orienting questions in biodiversity theory and ecology is the ``paradox of the plankton'', which asks how it is possible for many species to coexist on limited resources given the tendency for competition to exclude species. Over the past five decades, ecologists have offered dozens of solutions to the paradox, invoking game theory, chaos, stochastics, and many other concepts. Despite the plentitude of solutions to the paradox, ecologists continue to offer up novel solutions. Ocean modellers are now faced with the opposite paradox: given the overabundance and the diversity of solutions to the paradox, what is the appropriate way to build coexistence into ecosystem models? Ocean ecosystem models have a very standardized form\textemdash{}nutrient\textendash{}phytoplankton\textendash{}zooplankton (NPZ)-type systems of differential equations\textemdash{}where competitive exclusion is a common model behaviour. We suggest approaching the problem from the perspective of community-level patterns. We offer a prototype for building coexistence into NPZ models. The model allows for diverse assemblages of phytoplankton or zooplankton groups to persist and produces accurate community-level patterns. The approach is simple, adding only one additional parameter, and allows us to test the effects of trait distributions and environmental variables on diversity.},

The most recent of such events is linked to an abrupt collapse of primary production due to darkness following the Chicxulub asteroid impact 65.5 million years ago. Coastal phytoplankton groups (particularly dinoflagellates and diatoms) appear to have been resilient to this biotic crisis, but the reason for their high survival rates is still unknown. Here we show that the growth performance of dinoflagellate cells germinated from resting stages is unaffected by up to a century of dormancy. Our results clearly indicate that phytoplankton resting stages can endure periods of darkness far exceeding those estimated for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction and may effectively aid the rapid resurgence of primary production in coastal areas after events of prolonged photosynthesis shut-down.},

Member states assess GES according to 11 descriptors set out in the MSFD, and their associated indicators. An ecosystem service approach is increasingly being advocated to ensure sustainable use of the environment, and sets of indicators have been defined for ecosystem service assessments. We considered whether a selection of GES indicators related to biological descriptors, D1 Biodiversity, D2 Non-indigenous species, D4 Food webs and D6 Seafloor integrity, may provide information relevant to ecosystem services, potentially allowing use of collected environmental data for more than one purpose. Published lists of indicators for seven selected marine ecosystem services were compared to 296 biodiversity-related indicators included within the DEVOTOOL catalogue, established for screening marine biodiversity indicators for the MSFD. We concluded that 64 of these biodiversity indicators are directly comparable to the ecosystem service indicators under consideration. All 296 biodiversity indicators were then reassessed objectively to decide which of them could be useful as ecosystem service indicators. To carry out this step in a consistent and transparent manner, guidelines were developed among the co-authors that helped the decision making process for each individual indicator. 247 biodiversity indicators were identified as potentially useful ecosystem service indicators. By highlighting the comparability between ecosystem service and biodiversity indicators it is hoped that future monitoring effort can be used not only to ensure that GES is attained, but also that ecosystem service provision is maximised. It is recommended that these indicators should be tested across EU regional seas to see if they are useful in practice, and if ecosystem service assessments are comparable across regional seas.},

Here we describe and discuss a process to evaluate the selection of operational food-web indicators for use in evaluating marine ecosystem status. This process brought together experts in food-web ecology, marine ecology, and resource management, to identify available indicators that can be used to inform marine management. Standard evaluation criteria (availability and quality of data, conceptual basis, communicability, relevancy to management) were implemented to identify practical food-web indicators ready for operational use and indicators that hold promise for future use in policy and management. The major attributes of the final suite of operational food-web indicators were structure and functioning. Indicators that represent resilience of the marine ecosystem were less developed. Over 60 potential food-web indicators were evaluated and the final selection of operational food-web indicators includes: the primary production required to sustain a fishery, the productivity of seabirds (or charismatic megafauna), zooplankton indicators, primary productivity, integrated trophic indicators, and the biomass of trophic guilds. More efforts should be made to develop thresholds-based reference points for achieving Good Environmental Status. There is also a need for international collaborations to develop indicators that will facilitate management in marine ecosystems used by multiple countries.},

Ecologists describing phenomena on larger scales often use terms like "stability," "balance of nature," and "fragility," and Pimm begins by considering the various specific meanings of these terms. He addresses five kinds of ecological stability\textemdash{}stability in the strict sense, resilience, variability, persistence, and resistance\textemdash{}and shows how they provide ways of comparing natural populations and communities as well as theories about them. Each type of stability depends on characteristics of the species studied and also on the structure of the food web in which the species is embedded and the physical features of the environment.  The Balance of Nature? provides theoretical ecology with a rich array of questions\textemdash{}questions that also underpin pressing problems in practical conservation biology.

We provide analytical results complemented by simulations which show that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species rich systems. This result leaves us in the uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and stability is warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions. Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems. Our results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.},

Here we show that a large fraction of this space of possibilities exhibits generic behaviors that are robust to modeling choices. We consider a wide array of model features, including interaction types and community structures, known to generate different dynamics for a few species. We combine these features in large simulated communities, and show that equilibrium diversity, functioning, and stability can be predicted analytically using a random model parameterized by a few statistical properties of the community. We give an ecological interpretation of this ``disordered'' limit where structure fails to emerge from complexity. We also demonstrate that some well-studied interaction patterns remain relevant in large ecosystems, but their impact can be encapsulated in a minimal number of additional parameters. Our approach provides a powerful framework for predicting the outcomes of ecosystem assembly and quantifying the added value of more detailed models and measurements.},

Trait-based approaches to terrestrial plant communities have shown that functional traits can help reveal the mechanisms underlying community assembly, but such approaches have not been tested on the microbes that dominate ecosystem processes in the ocean. Here, we test whether functional traits can explain community responses to seasonal environmental fluctuation, using a time series of the phytoplankton of the English Channel. We show that interspecific variation in response to major limiting resources, light and nitrate, can be well-predicted by lab-measured traits characterising light utilisation, nitrate utilisation and maximum growth rate. As these relationships were predicted a priori, using independently measured traits, our results show that functional traits provide a strong mechanistic foundation for understanding the structure and dynamics of ecological communities.},

Earlier studies often assumed a community with only one interaction type, either an antagonistic, competitive, or mutualistic interaction, leaving open the question of what the diversity of interaction types contributes to the community maintenance. We show theoretically that the multiple interaction types might hold the key to understanding community dynamics. A moderate mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics. Furthermore, increasing complexity leads to increased stability in a ``hybrid'' community. We hypothesize that the diversity of species and interaction types may be the essential element of biodiversity that maintains ecological communities.

  abstract = {Ecological theory suggests that large-scale patterns such as community stability can be influenced by changes in interspecific interactions that arise from the behavioural and/or physiological responses of individual species varying over time1,2,3. Although this theory has experimental support2,4,5, evidence from natural ecosystems is lacking owing to the challenges of tracking rapid changes in interspecific interactions (known to occur on timescales much shorter than a generation time)6 and then identifying the effect of such changes on large-scale community dynamics. Here, using tools for analysing nonlinear time series6,7,8,9 and a 12-year-long dataset of fortnightly collected observations on a natural marine fish community in Maizuru Bay, Japan, we show that short-term changes in interaction networks influence overall community dynamics. Among the 15 dominant species, we identify 14 interspecific interactions to construct a dynamic interaction network. We show that the strengths, and even types, of interactions change with time; we also develop a time-varying stability measure based on local Lyapunov stability for attractor dynamics in non-equilibrium nonlinear systems. We use this dynamic stability measure to examine the link between the time-varying interaction network and community stability. We find seasonal patterns in dynamic stability for this fish community that broadly support expectations of current ecological theory. Specifically, the dominance of weak interactions and higher species diversity during summer months are associated with higher dynamic stability and smaller population fluctuations. We suggest that interspecific interactions, community network structure and community stability are dynamic properties, and that linking fluctuating interaction networks to community-level dynamic properties is key to understanding the maintenance of ecological communities in nature.},

Although theories have been proposed to explain the generally positive relationship between, for example, biodiversity and productivity, it remains unclear which mechanisms underlie the observed variations in Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function (BEF) relationships. Using a continuous trait-distribution model for a phytoplankton community of gleaners competing with opportunists, and subjecting it to differing frequencies of disturbance, we find that species selection tends to enhance temporal species complementarity, which is maximised at high disturbance frequency and intermediate functional diversity. This leads to the emergence of a trade-off whereby increasing diversity tends to enhance short-term adaptive capacity under frequent disturbance while diminishing long-term productivity under infrequent disturbance. BEF relationships therefore depend on both disturbance frequency and the timescale of observation.},

Total phytoplankton cell volume largely followed the trend of total phosphorus concentration, albeit short-term fluctuations existed. However, phytoplankton community shifted dramatically in response to those changes of environmental states. These shifts were cause by changes in trophic status driven by phosphorus loadings and physical properties in the water column driven by warming.

While processes of community assembly have frequently been analyzed from an ecological perspective, their evolutionary dimensions have so far received less attention. To elucidate the eco-evolutionary processes underlying the long-term build-up and potential collapse of community diversity, here we develop and examine an individual-based model describing coevolutionary dynamics driven by trophic interactions and interference competition, of a pair of quantitative traits determining predator and prey niches. Our results demonstrate the (1) emergence of communities with multiple trophic levels, shown here for the first time for stochastic models with linear functional responses, and (2) intermittent and cyclic evolutionary transitions between two alternative community states. In particular, our results indicate that the interplay of ecological and evolutionary dynamics often results in extinction cascades that remove the entire trophic level of consumers from a community. Finally, we show the (3) robustness of our results under variations of model assumptions, underscoring that processes of consumer collapse and subsequent rebound could be important elements of understanding biodiversity dynamics in natural communities.},

Using a simulation approach in tandem with key results from random matrix theory, we illustrate how historical assembly mechanisms alter the structure of ecological networks. We demonstrate that different community assembly scenarios can lead to the emergence of structures that are often interpreted as evidence of `selection for stability'. However, by controlling for the underlying selection pressures, we show that these assembly artefacts\textemdash{}or spandrels\textemdash{}are completely unrelated to stability or selection, and are instead by-products of how new species are introduced into the system. We propose that these network-assembly spandrels are critically overlooked aspects of network theory and stability analysis, and we illustrate how a failure to adequately account for historical assembly can lead to incorrect inference about the causes and consequences of ecological stability.},

  issn = {1939-9170},
  abstract = {The importance of competition and predation in structuring ecological communities is typically examined separately such that interactions between these processes are seldom understood. By causing large reductions in native prey, invasive predators may modify native species interactions. I conducted a manipulative field experiment in The Bahamas to investigate the possibility that the invasive Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) alters competition between planktivorous fairy and blackcap basslets (Gramma loreto and Gramma melacara, respectively). Competition between these coral-reef fishes is known to have symmetrical effects on the juveniles of both species, whereby the feeding positions under reef ledges and growth rates of these individuals are hindered. Following baseline censuses of local populations of competing basslets, I simultaneously manipulated the abundance of lionfish on entire reefs, and the abundance of basslets in local populations under isolated ledges within each reef, resulting in three treatments: unmanipulated control populations of both basslets, reduced abundance of fairy basslet, and reduced abundance of blackcap basslet. For eight weeks, I measured the change in biomass and feeding position of 2\textendash{}5 cm size classes of each basslet species and calculated the growth rates of 2 cm individuals using a standard mark-and-recapture method. Experimental populations were filmed at dusk using automated video cameras to quantify the behavior of lionfish overlapping with basslets. Video playback revealed lionfish hunted across all ledge positions, regardless of which basslet species were present, yet lionfish differentially reduced the biomass of only juvenile (2 cm) fairy basslet. Predation reduced the effects of interspecific competition on juvenile blackcap basslet as evidenced by corresponding shifts in feeding position toward coveted front edges of ledges and increases in growth rates that were comparable to the response of these fish in populations where competition was experimentally reduced. Thus, an invasive marine predator altered the outcome of interspecific competition via differential predation, which tipped the balance of competition between native prey species from symmetrical to asymmetrical effects on juveniles. This study reveals a newly demonstrated context in which predation can indirectly facilitate prey, further broadening our understanding of the interactive effects of predation and competition in the context of invasive species.},

Its structure allows us to derive an accurate approximation for the individual-based model that predicts mean densities and size structures using the same parameter values and functional forms, and also it is analytically tractable. The approximation is represented by a system of von Foerster partial differential equations coupled with an integral equation that we call the perfect plasticity approximation (PPA). We have derived a series of analytical results including equilibrium abundances for trees of different crown shapes, stability conditions, transient behaviors, such as the constant yield law and self-thinning exponents, and two species coexistence conditions.},

  abstract = {The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) by using short-term ({$\leq$}15-year) inventory data from individual trees. We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development. Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical metrics for early-successional performance (H20, height of a 20-year-old open-grown tree) and late-successional performance ({\^Z}*, equilibrium canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing {\^Z}* showed that (i) succession is driven both by superior understory performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional species, and (ii) performance differences primarily reflect differences in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (Quercus rubra) and mesic (codominance by Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum) soil. On hydromesic and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant species in old stands (Thuja occidentalis) is now failing to regenerate. Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species (e.g., Fraxinus nigra, A. rubrum).},

I want to draw the attention to another, radically different kind of complex system, in fact one that many scientists regard as the only genuine kind of complex system. Instead of being compositionally complex these systems rather exhibit highly non-trivial dynamical patterns on the basis of structurally simple arrangements of large numbers of non-linearly interacting constituents. The characteristic dynamical patterns in what I call ``dynamically complex systems'' arise from the interaction of the system's parts largely irrespective of many properties of these parts. Dynamically complex systems can exhibit surprising statistical characteristics, the robustness of which calls for an explanation in terms of underlying generating mechanisms. However, I want to argue, dynamically complex systems are not sufficiently covered by the available conceptions of mechanisms. I will explore how the notion of a mechanism has to be modified to accommodate this case. Moreover, I will show under which conditions the widespread, if not inflationary talk about mechanisms in (dynamically) complex systems stretches the notion of mechanisms beyond its reasonable limits and is no longer legitimate.},

The two are associated with different heuristics, holism and reductionism, which many view as incompatible. Second, I will provide a different analysis of abstractions and the associated heuristics than previous authors. Reductionism and holism and the accompanying abstractions have different methodological and epistemic functions, strengths, and limitations, and the heuristics should be viewed as providing complementary research perspectives of cognitively limited beings. This is then, third, used as a premise to argue for epistemic and methodological pluralism in theoretical ecology. Finally, the presented taxonomy of abstractions is used to comment on the current debate whether mechanistic accounts of explanation are compatible with the use of abstractions. This debate has suffered from an abstract discussion of abstractions. With a better taxonomy of abstractions the debate can be resolved.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have greatly advanced our understanding of the processes that regulate trophic structure and dynamics in ecosystems. However, the causes of systematic variation among ecosystems remain controversial and poorly elucidated. Contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in particular have inspired much speculation, but only recent empirical quantification. Here, we review evidence for systematic differences in energy flow and biomass partitioning between producers and herbivores, detritus and decomposers, and higher trophic levels. The magnitudes of different trophic pathways vary considerably, with less herbivory, more decomposers and more detrital accumulation on land. Aquatic\textendash{}terrestrial differences are consistent across the global range of primary productivity, indicating that structural contrasts between the two systems are preserved despite large variation in energy input. We argue that variable selective forces drive differences in plant allocation patterns in aquatic and terrestrial environments that propagate upward to shape food webs. The small size and lack of structural tissues in phytoplankton mean that aquatic primary producers achieve faster growth rates and are more nutritious to heterotrophs than their terrestrial counterparts. Plankton food webs are also strongly size-structured, while size and trophic position are less strongly correlated in most terrestrial (and many benthic) habitats. The available data indicate that contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial food webs are driven primarily by the growth rate, size and nutritional quality of autotrophs. Differences in food-web architecture (food chain length, the prevalence of omnivory, specialization or anti-predator defences) may arise as a consequence of systematic variation in the character of the producer community.},

  abstract = {This paper tests the proposition that a small set of plant, animal, and abiotic processes structure ecosystems across scales in time and space. Earlier studies have suggested that these key structuring processes establish a small number of dominant temporal frequencies that entrain other processes. These frequencies often differ from each other by at least an order of magnitude. If true, ecosystems therefore will have a few dominant frequencies that are endogenously driven and that are discontinuously distributed. This paper additionally tests the proposition that these structuring processes should also generate a discontinuous distribution of spatial structures coupled with the discontinuous frequencies. If that is the case, animals living in specific landscapes should demonstrate the existence of this lumpy architecture by showing gaps in the distribution of their sizes. This proved to be the case for birds and mammals of the boreal region forest and the short\textemdash{}grass prairie. Alternative hypotheses to explain the body mass clumps include architectural, developmental, historical, and trophic causes. These were all tested by comparing body\textemdash{}mass clump distributions (1) in ecosystems having different spatial structures (forest, grassland, and marine pelagic) and (2) in different animal groups having different body plans (birds and mammals) or feeding habits (carnivore, omnivore, and herbivore). The only hypothesis that could not be rejected is that the body\textemdash{}mass clumps are entrained by discontinuous hierarchical structures and textures of the landscape. There is evidence for at least eight distinct habitat 'quanta,' each defined by a distinct texture at a specific range of scales. These eight quanta together cover tens of centimetres to hundreds of kilometres in space and at least months to millennia in time. There is a striking similarity, but not identity, between the clump structure of prairie and boreal animals. This indicates that many processes that form qualitative habitat structure are common to both landscapes or ecosystems, but a few are landscape specific, particularly over larger scales. That conclusion is extended to all terrestrial ecosystems by an analysis of the body\textemdash{}mass clump structure of all North American birds. In contrast, there are striking differences in clump structure between landscapes and 'waterscapes,' indicating that fundamentally different processes shape structure in terrestrial and open ocean systems. The discontinuous body\textemdash{}mass structure provides a bioassay of discontinuous ecosystem structure. Mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores all show the same number of body\textemdash{}mass clumps, and the gaps in these distributions occur at the same body masses. Mammals and birds show the same number of body\textemdash{}mass clumps, but the mass gaps for mammals occur at larger sizes than those for birds in such a way that the log\textemdash{}transformed body\textemdash{}mass gaps for mammals are correlated linearly with those for birds. Hence there is a simple cross\textemdash{}calibration between the mammal and bird bioassays. I compiled and analyzed published data on home ranges in order to convert body masses into an absolute linear measure of geometric structures in the landscape. A new and general equation was developed relating home\textemdash{}range size to body mass, and was tested by reanalyzing published data for mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores and for birds. I conclude: (1) Birds and mammals of all trophic levels utilize resources in their foraging areas in the same way by measuring the spatial grain of habitat patches with a resolution defined as a function of their size (i.e., the animal's step length or minimum unit of measurement). The step length is a morphological function of the size of animals and is not significantly affected by trophic status or taxonomy of the groups considered. That explains why all trophic levels and both birds and mammals show the same qualitative body\textemdash{}mass clump structure. (2) Home\textemdash{}range data can convert the body\textemdash{}mass data to a quantitative estimate of texture, i.e., of fractal dimension of the landscape. The landscape forms a hierarchy that contains breaks in object sizes, object proximities, and textures at particular scales. Animals also demonstrate a hierarchy of decisions whose target suddenly shifts at specific scales in space and time. The interaction between these two hierarchies produces the discontinuous body\textemdash{}mass clump structure. The breaks in geometry in the landscape occur because structuring processes exert their influence over defined ranges of scale. The temporal and architectural structure of habitat quanta are in general determined by three classes of processes, each dominating over three different ranges of scale. Vegetative processes that determine plant growth, plant form, and soil structure dominate the formation of texture at fine microscales of centimetres to tens of metres in space and days to decades in time. At the other, macroscale extreme, slow geomorphological processes dominate the formation of a topographic and edaphic structure at large scales of hundreds to thousands of kilometres and centuries to millennia. At the mesoscales in between, contagious disturbance processes such as fire, insect outbreak, plant disease, and water flow dominate the formation of patterns over spatial scales of hundreds of metres to hundreds of kilometres. In addition, the direct impacts of grazing by large herbivores and of human activities, and the indirect effects of large predators and animal disease, further transform spatial patterns over these meso\textemdash{}scales. These processes operate on time scales of years to decades, making them critically important in determining whether present local, regional, and global human influences will trigger a transition in vegetation types, and, if so, how rapidly. The paper provides a direction for the development of programs to evaluate, monitor, and predict ecosystem and community changes across scales. The necessary research elements include (1) models that incorporate a few scale\textemdash{}dependent structuring processes to allow cross\textemdash{}scale analysis; (2) comparative studies of different disturbed and undisturbed landscapes using the animal body\textemdash{}mass bioassay technique to identify critical scales of ecosystem geometry; (3) analysis of remote imagery to identify spatial discontinuities and regions of scale invariance; and (4) behavioral studies of the hierarchy of animal decisions to identify species groups vulnerable to predicted (using models) or observed (using remote imagery) changes in vegetation geometry.},

Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.},

  abstract = {Among approaches to establish the importance of niche differentiation for species coexistence, the use of functional traits is attractive for its potential to suggest specific coexistence mechanisms. Recent studies have looked for trait patterns reflective of niche differentiation, building on a line of research with a deep but somewhat neglected history. We review the field from its foundation in limiting similarity theory in the 1960s to its resurgence in 2000s, and find the theory of trait patterning still in a stage of development. Elements still to be accounted for include environmental fluctuations, multidimensional niche space, transient dynamics, immigration, intraspecific variation, evolution and spatial scales. Recent empirical methods are better than early approaches, but still focus on patterning arising in simplistic models, and should rigorously link niche space with trait space, use informative null models, and adopt new metrics of pattern as theory develops. Because tests based on overly simplistic expectations of trait pattern are of little value, we argue that progress in the field requires theory development, which should entail exploring patterns across a set of conceptual and system-specific models of competition along trait axes. Synthesis Traits relate to ecological performance and are easy to measure. Trait patterns can thus be a practical tool for inferring community assembly processes, and have been extensively used for this purpose. Classical trait patterning theory dates back to the 1960s, and despite heavy criticism still persists in empirical studies. Here we highlight steps needed for traits to realize their potential. These include firmly linking them to niche axes, and updating pattern expectations to consider recent results from models of niche dynamics, such as the emergence of species clusters. Further theory development should reveal whether there is a common traits-based signature across different niche mechanisms.},

Interspecific competition has been suggested to play a role in such structuring of communities.

There is now a deeper understanding of how competitive interactions influence community structure, for instance, how the shape of competition kernels can determine the clustering of species' traits. Competition is typically weaker for greater phenotypic difference, and the shape of the dependence defines a competition kernel. The clustering tendencies of kernels interact with other effects, such as variation in resource availability along a niche axis, but the kernel shape can have a decisive influence on community structure. Here we review and further extend the recent developments and evaluate their importance.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have long agreed that to coexist species must be sufficiently different (1, 2). This worldview was challenged when Stephen Hubbell published his neutral theory of biodiversity showing that species that are essentially equal should also be able to evade competitive exclusion (3). Although this neutral theory inspired a fresh look at biodiversity, it also met resistance as it seemed to violate the deeply held belief that all species are fundamentally different. Interestingly, a harmonious combination of niche differentiation and neutrality can emerge naturally in simulated communities, thus suggesting a way of unifying the niche and neutral view (4). A peculiar prediction of this theory of emergent neutrality is that species should be distributed over niche space in a lumpy way, a pattern that is indeed often observed in nature (5{$\Downarrow\Downarrow\Downarrow$}\textendash{}9). In this view the lumps correspond to niches, while species within lumps are essentially more of the same, reflecting two alternative ways for species to coexist: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar (Fig. 1). A study in PNAS now lends important support to this unifying theory by showing its compatibility with Tilman's widely embraced theory of competition for resources (10).

The theoretical prediction that coexistence of two species requires sufficient niche differentiation (2) has become one of the cornerstones of ecology. It also makes intuitive sense. The smaller the niche overlap, the weaker the competition \ldots{}

  abstract = {The effect of life-history traits on resource competition outcomes is well understood in the context of a constant resource supply. However, almost all natural systems are subject to fluctuations of resources driven by cyclical processes such as seasonality and tidal hydrology. To understand community composition, it is therefore imperative to study the impact of resource fluctuations on interspecies competition. We adapted a well-established resource-competition model to show that fluctuations in inflow concentrations of two limiting resources lead to the survival of species in clumps along the trait axis, consistent with observations of ``lumpy coexistence'' [Scheffer M, van Nes EH (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:6230\textendash{}6235]. A complex dynamic pattern in the available ambient resources arose very early in the self-organization process and dictated the locations of clumps along the trait axis by creating niches that promoted the growth of species with specific traits. This dynamic pattern emerged as the combined result of fluctuations in the inflow of resources and their consumption by the most competitive species that accumulated the bulk of biomass early in assemblage organization. Clumps emerged robustly across a range of periodicities, phase differences, and amplitudes. Given the ubiquity in the real world of asynchronous fluctuations of limiting resources, our findings imply that assemblage organization in clumps should be a common feature in nature.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

It supplies 50\% of the total potable water requirements, 40\% of the industry take, and 20\% of agriculture groundwater is a strategic resource for every country. That common-pool resources are highly susceptible to lead to a tragedy of the commons is a well-known fact. We claim that a combination of groundwater modeling, optimization, and a game theoretical analysis may in fact avoid the tragedy. A groundwater model in MODFLOW from Zamora aquifer in Mexico was used as input of a basic but instructive, optimization problem: extract the greatest possible volume of water, but at the same time minimizing the drawdown and drawdown velocity. The solutions of the optimization problem were used to construct the payoffs of a hypothetical game among the aquifer users, the resource's administrator, and a resource protector entity. We show that the success of the optimal management program depends heavily on the information that the users have about the resource. Therefore, better decision-making processes are a consequence of sustainability literacy. Particularly, water literacy could lead to the usage of water considering it as a part of an ecosystem and not only as a natural resource. Additionally, a new non-classical equation for underground flow was derived, that may be specially important to understand and predict the groundwater flow in highly heterogeneous conditions as in karstic aquifers or fractured media.

Hence it can lead to situations akin to the tragedy of the commons, with adaptations that serve the selfish interests of individuals ultimately ruining a population. For frequency-dependent selection to play such a role, it must not be optimizing. Together, all published studies of evolutionary suicide have created the impression that evolutionary suicide is not possible with optimizing selection. Here we disprove this misconception by presenting and analyzing an example in which optimizing selection causes self-extinction. We then take this line of argument one step further by showing, in a further example, that selection-driven self-extinction can occur even under frequency-independent selection.

Ecological resilience was defined as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures (defined as alternative stable states). Other authors consider resilience as a return time to a stable state following a perturbation. A new term, adaptive capacity, is introduced to describe the processes that modify ecological resilience. Two definitions recognize the presence of multiple stable states (or stability domains), and hence resilience is the property that mediates transition among these states. Transitions among stable states have been described for many ecosystems, including semi-arid rangelands, lakes, coral reefs, and forests. In these systems, ecological resilience is maintained by keystone structuring processes across a number of scales, sources of renewal and reformation, and functional biodiversity. In practice, maintaining a capacity for renewal in a dynamic environment provides an ecological buffer that protects the system from the failure of management actions that are taken based upon incomplete understanding, and it allows managers to affordably learn and change.},

Here we study the coupled dynamics of human socio-economic choice and lake water pollution, and examine the magnitude of the difference in cooperation levels between two groups. In the model, many players choose between a costly but cooperative option and a selfish option. The former results in a reduced phosphorus discharge into the lake. Each player's choice is affected by an economic cost and social pressure. Social pressure is a psychological factor that promotes cooperation: it becomes stronger when more players in the society are cooperative (conformist tendency) and when the problem at hand is a greater concern to society. In the model, two groups sometimes show large differences in their cooperation levels even when both have exactly the same social factors. However, cooperation levels are more likely to differ between groups that have different social factors. Enhancement of the cross-group conformist tendency is the most effective way to minimize differences in cooperation levels and to mitigate conflict between groups.},

  abstract = {Numerous indicator approaches are found in the scientific literature to describe changes in biodiversity. It is however far from clear which indicators are most appropriate and which are less suitable to summarize trends in biodiversity. One reason for this lack of clarity is that so far the mathematical properties of indicator approaches have had little attention. In this paper, we derive a number of desirable mathematical properties of indicators from economic price-index theory and apply these in the form of tests to 10 metrics to summarize changes in biodiversity. The metrics species richness, Simpson index, Shannon index, Buckland's modified Shannon index and S{\o}rensen's similarity coefficient violate the monotonicity and proportionality test. The percentage of increasing minus declining species also fails the proportionality test, and in the case where trends are assessed relative to the preceding year, this metric also violates the identity test. Most of these indicators are sensitive to spatial scale. The arithmetic and geometric mean of population indices and the mean abundance have better mathematical performance, but the first two are sensitive to appearing and disappearing species in the system surveyed. The metric mean abundance however can only be applied under particular conditions and has some undesirable properties. Unlike the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean is not sensitive to the base year chosen and has the most favourable mathematical properties of the indicators evaluated. The geometric mean can be straightforwardly extended to take into account unequal values of species if desired.},

Failure to acknowledge and treat uncertainty can lead to poor decisions. To illustrate the importance of considering uncertainty, we reanalyze a decision problem for the Sumatran rhino, Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, using information-gap theory to propagate uncertainties and to rank management options. Rather than requiring information about the extent of parameter uncertainty at the outset, information-gap theory addresses the question of how much uncertainty can be tolerated before our decision would change. It assesses the robustness of decisions in the face of severe uncertainty. We show that different management decisions may result when uncertainty in utilities and probabilities are considered in decision-making problems. We highlight the importance of a full assessment of uncertainty in conservation management decisions to avoid, as much as possible, undesirable outcomes.},

Trophic interactions can be considered as one of the most important key predictors of the variation in the fish size structure in lakes. Furthermore, the taxonomic-based approaches and other functional traits can be integrated in the study of the fish size structure to increase the accuracy of the understanding of ecological processes.

  abstract = {Zooplankton on continental shelves represent an important intermediary in the transfer of energy and matter from phytoplankton to the wider ecosystem. Their taxonomic composition and trophic interactions with phytoplankton vary in space and time, and interpreting the implications of this constantly evolving landscape remains a major challenge. Here we combine plankton taxonomic data with the analysis of biovolume spectra and stable isotopes to provide insights into the trophic interactions that occur in a shelf sea ecosystem (Celtic Sea) across the spring-summer-autumn transition. Biovolume spectra captured the seasonal development of the zooplankton community well, both in terms of total biomass and trophic positioning, and matched trophic positions estimated by stable isotope analysis. In early April, large microplankton (63\textendash{}200 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}m) occupied higher trophic positions than mesozooplankton ({$>$}200 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}m), likely reflecting the predominance of nanoplankton (2\textendash{}20 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}m) that were not readily available to mesozooplankton grazers. Biomass and number of trophic levels increased during the spring bloom as elevated primary production allowed for a higher abundance of predatory species. During July, the plankton assemblage occupied relatively high trophic positions, indicating important links to the microbial loop and the recycling of organic matter. The strong correlation between biomass and community trophic level across the study suggests that the Celtic Sea is a relatively enclosed and predominantly energy-limited ecosystem. The progression of the zooplankton biomass and community structure within the central shelf region was different to that at the shelf-break, potentially reflecting increased predatory control of copepods by macrozooplankton and pelagic fishes at the shelf break. We suggest that the combination of size spectra and stable isotope techniques are highly complementary and useful for interpreting the seasonal progression of trophic interactions in the plankton.},

  abstract = {The regularity of the community size-spectrum, i.e., the fact that the total ecosystem biomass contained in logarithmically equal body size intervals remains constant, is a striking characteristic of marine ecosystems. Community size-spectrum models exploit this feature to represent marine ecosystems with two measures: the slope and the intercept (height) of the community spectrum. Size-spectrum models have gain popularity over time to model the properties of fish communities, whether to investigate the impact of fishing, or embedded into end-to-end models to investigate the impact of climate. We review the main features and state of the art developments in the domain of continuous size-spectrum models. The community spectrum emerges from a balance between size-selective predation, growth and biomass dissipation. Further to these basic components, reproduction and various causes of mortality have been introduced in recent studies to increase the model's realism or simply close the mass budget of the spectrum. These different processes affect the stability of the spectrum and affect the predictions of the size-spectrum models. A few models have also introduced a representation of life-history traits in the community size-spectrum. This allows accounting for the diversity of energy pathways in food webs and for the fact that metabolism is both size- and species-specific. The community-level metabolism therefore depends on the species composition of the community. The size-spectrum's regularity at the community level can serve as a conceptual basis for building theories of marine ecosystems' functioning. It is also used as indicator of anthropogenic and natural disturbances. The mechanistic nature of size-spectrum models as well as their simple and aggregated representation of complex systems makes them good candidates as a strategic management tool. For instance, for testing the impact of different fishing management actions or for projecting marine ecosystem's states under various climate change scenarios.},

Temporal shifts in cascade strength\textemdash{}including those driven by contemporary global change\textemdash{}can either stabilize or destabilize ecological communities.

To predict their ecosystem-wide consequences we must understand how these impacts propagate. A long-standing, but so far elusive, problem in this endeavour is how to reduce food web complexity to a mathematically tractable, but empirically relevant system. Simplification to main energy channels linking primary producers to top consumers has been recently advocated. Following this approach, we propose a general framework for the analysis of bottom-up and top-down forcing of ecosystems by reducing food webs to two energy pathways originating from a limiting resource shared by competing guilds of primary producers (e.g. edible vs. defended plants). Exploring dynamical models of such webs we find that their equilibrium responses to nutrient enrichment and top consumer harvesting are determined by only two easily measurable topological properties: the lengths of the component food chains (odd\textendash{}odd, odd\textendash{}even, or even\textendash{}even) and presence vs. absence of a generalist top consumer reconnecting the two pathways (yielding looped vs. branched webs). Many results generalise to other looped or branched web structures and the model can be easily adapted to include a detrital pathway.},

With the number of reported cases quickly growing, key features and commonalities have emerged. Fishery-induced trophic cascades often display differential response times and nonlinear trajectories among trophic levels and can be accompanied by shifts in alternative states. Furthermore, their magnitude appears to be context dependent, varying as a function of species diversity, regional oceanography, local physical disturbance, habitat complexity, and the nature of the fishery itself. To conserve and manage exploited marine ecosystems, there is a pressing need for an improved understanding of the conditions that promote or inhibit the cascading consequences of fishing. Future research should investigate how the trophic effects of fishing interact with other human disturbances, identify strongly interacting species and ecosystem features that confer resilience to exploitation, determine ranges of predator depletion that elicit trophic cascades, pinpoint antecedents that signal ecosystem state shifts, and quantify variation in trophic rates across oceanographic conditions. This information will advance predictive models designed to forecast the trophic effects of fishing and will allow managers to better anticipate and avoid fishery-induced trophic cascades.},

  issn = {0012-9658},
  abstract = {I derived predictions about how the magnitude of Daphnia effects on total phytoplankton biomass should vary across a gradient of enrichment (expressed as algal carrying capacity) using two, simple predator-prey models. These predictions were then compared with data from a survey of field experiments in temperate lakes. Algal responses to Daphnia manipulation were quantified as an Algal Response Factor (ARF), defined as total algal biomass in the low-Daphnia treatment divided by total algal biomass in the high-Daphnia treatment. Total phosphorus concentration (TP) was used as an index of algal carrying capacity, ranging from 10 to 460 @mg/L over the 22 experiments surveyed. The Algal Response Factor ranged from 1 to 40 and was a positive, linear function of TP: ARF = @o0.14 + 0.08(TP), r\^2 = 0.81; log ARF = @o0.81 + 0.83(log TP), r\^2 = 0.75. Thus, algal carrying capacity, as quantified by TP, explains much of the variation in Daphnia effects on total algal biomass across lakes. The survey results supported the prediction of the simpler model, a two-species, Lotka-Volterra model of pure exploitation. Incorporating the additional complexity of inedible algae into this model did little to improve its predictive power. The conclusion that inedible algae are not of major importance to the prediction of Daphnia effects across an enrichment gradient was supported by a survey of Daphnia effects on the proportionate biomass of inedible algae. There was no evidence that Daphnia grazing typically favors dominance by inedible algae at equilibrium in highly enriched lakes. My results suggest that the well-established positive relationship between TP and equilibrium algal biomass in lakes is more likely to be a consequence of increases in Daphnia's death rate with enrichment, rather than decreases in Daphnia's feeding and assimilation rates. When zooplanktivorous fish are rare, Daphnia should be able to prevent phytoplankton biomass from responding to nutrient addition at equilibrium. As a consequence, the success of biomanipulation in eutrophic lakes should critically depend upon the effectiveness of strategies aimed at reducing zooplanktivory.},

A general decrease of the slope, as suggested by most of the studied models, is supported by the data found. The investigated empirical studies revealed a strong trend for the slope: 40 out of 57 studies reported a decrease with stress. Deviations from the linear model increased in 10 out of 20 cases and the intercept became larger in 25 out of 43 cases. The data concerning specific impact drivers is generally consistent and supportive of current expert opinions. Our results support that an integration of deviation from the linear model and intercept in the size spectra models could provide better coupling between modeling and field surveys for some stressors.},

Since maxima equidistant in x obey a geometric progression in the variable r, Titius-Bode type of laws are natural outcome of the linear regime of systems in which both symmetries are present; we discuss possible nonlinear corrections to the law.

  abstract = {Trophic cascades have been documented in a diversity of ecological systems and can be important in determining biomass distribution within a community. To date, the literature on trophic cascades has focused on whether and in which systems cascades occur. Many biological (e.g., productivity : biomass ratios) and methodological (e.g., experiment size or duration) factors vary with the ecosystem in which data were collected, but ecosystem type, per se, does not provide mechanistic insights into factors controlling cascade strength. Here, we tested various hypotheses about why trophic cascades occur and what determines their magnitude using data from 114 studies that measured the indirect trophic effects of predators on plant community biomass in seven aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Using meta-analysis, we examined the relationship between the indirect effect of predator manipulation on plants and 18 biological and methodological factors quantified from these studies. We found, in contrast to predictions, that high system productivity and low species diversity do not consistently generate larger trophic cascades. A combination of herbivore and predator metabolic factors and predator taxonomy (vertebrate vs. invertebrate) explained 31\% of the variation in cascade strength among all 114 studies. Within systems, 18\% of the variation in cascade strength was explained with similar predator and herbivore characteristics. Within and across all systems, the strongest cascades occurred in association with invertebrate herbivores and endothermic vertebrate predators. These associations may result from a combination of true biological differences among species with different physiological requirements and bias among organisms studied in different systems. Thus, although cascade strength can be described by biological characteristics of predators and herbivores, future research on indirect trophic effects must further examine biological and methodological differences among studies and systems.},

This inclusion of complex predator\textendash{}prey linkages and realistic prey preferences yields a system with an emergent pattern of phytoplankton diversity consistent with global ocean observations, i.e., a parabolic relationship between diversity (as measured by the Shannon evenness) and biomass. It also yields significant long-term time evolution, which places limits on the extent to which the community response to nutrient forcing can be predicted from forcing in a pragmatic sense. When a simple annual cycle in nutrient supply is repeated exactly for many years, transient fluctuations up to a factor of two in spring bloom magnitude persist for 10\textendash{}20 years before a stable seasonal biomass cycle is achieved. When the amplitude of the nutrient-supply annual cycle is given a random interannual modulation, these long-lived transients add significant noise to a 100-year correlation between annual-mean nutrient supply and annual-mean biomass. This noise is 20\% of total interannual variance in the model base case, and ranges from 0\% to 40\% depending on the grazer size selectivity. In general, unpredictability on the bloom timescale is damped when food-web complexity is increased by making grazers less selective, while unpredictability on the interannual scale shows the opposite pattern, increasing with increasing food-web complexity up to a high threshhold, past which community structure and biomass time evolution both suddenly simplify. These results suggests a new strategy for ensemble ecosystem forecasting and uncertainty estimation, analogous to methods common in circulation and climate modeling, in which internal variability (predator\textendash{}prey interactions in the biological case; eddies and climate-system oscillations in the physical case) are resolved and quantified, rather than suppressed.},

The power of the logarithm of diameter as predictor variable must be avoided because this leads to worst adjustment and higher prediction uncertainty. Tree height as a third predictor variable gives the best adjustment and reduces the uncertainty on the biomass prediction around 8 t/ha less than model with the two other predictor variables, the diameter and the wood specific density.

These aspects are taken into account to build a new spatially explicit forest growth model called TROLL. Competition for light is modelled by calculating exactly the three-dimensional field of photosynthetically active radiation in the forest understorey. Typically, 106 light intensities are computed per hectare at each time step. This light field controls the growth of each tree and establishment/death events. Seed dispersal, dormancy and establishment success as well as a model of treefalls are also included. A special care is paid to the justification and to the validation of each of these modules. The TROLL model is parameterized for a Neotropical rain forest in French Guiana using 12 functional groups of species. Using this model the vertical canopy structure and the tree diametric distribution are investigated. The role of treefalls in maintaining pioneer species is also evidenced. A forest succession scenario is simulated and compared to field data. The model is then used to simulate the recolonization of a previously sterilized area by a rain forest plant community. This scenario is interpreted using information available from palaeorecords over the Holocene period and their validity is discussed. It is suggested that this model could be used to study mosaic-like patterns in rain forests, installation of slowly dispersing species, speciation hypotheses and landscape scale dynamics of rain forests.},

Here, we review the state of knowledge regarding MTF tree mortality, create a conceptual framework with testable hypotheses regarding the drivers, mechanisms and interactions that may underlie increasing MTF mortality rates, and identify the next steps for improved understanding and reduced prediction. Increasing mortality rates are associated with rising temperature and vapor pressure deficit, liana abundance, drought, wind events, fire and, possibly, CO2 fertilization-induced increases in stand thinning or acceleration of trees reaching larger, more vulnerable heights. The majority of these mortality drivers may kill trees in part through carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. The relative importance of each driver is unknown. High species diversity may buffer MTFs against large-scale mortality events, but recent and expected trends in mortality drivers give reason for concern regarding increasing mortality within MTFs. Models of tropical tree mortality are advancing the representation of hydraulics, carbon and demography, but require more empirical knowledge regarding the most common drivers and their subsequent mechanisms. We outline critical datasets and model developments required to test hypotheses regarding the underlying causes of increasing MTF mortality rates, and improve prediction of future mortality under climate change.},

A few promising but yet `unfinished' examples do exist in the region and we review these cases to draw lessons and recommendations.

  volume = {143},
  issn = {0006-3207},
  abstract = {The biodiversity of West African rainforests is globally significant but poorly described, little understood in terms of its functional significance, and under threat from forest loss and degradation. Estimates suggest that about 10 million ha of forest may have been lost in the 20th Century, and around 80\% of the original forest area is now an agriculture-forest mosaic. These highly modified forests provide food, fuel, fibre and a range of ecosystem services for over 200 million people. As a consequence, the future of biodiversity in the region is intimately linked with the lives and livelihoods of local people. The available evidence suggests that forest loss and degradation has been caused primarily by agricultural expansion, sometimes facilitated by other human activities such as wood extraction. This expansion is a response to the demand generated by a growing and increasingly urbanised human population, but has been exacerbated by small increases in crop yields over recent decades. We synthesize and review our state of knowledge on the value of human-modified habitats for forest biodiversity in the region. Data on biodiversity are patchy, but we show that across plant, invertebrate and vertebrate groups, there is a significant loss of forest species as tree cover is reduced and vegetation structure simplified. Agricultural expansion clearly causes significant local biodiversity loss. We argue that replicated landscape-scale studies are now needed that describe changes across a range of biodiversity groups (above and below ground) in relation to land-use and landscape context to address knowledge gaps and biases. Such descriptive studies need to be complemented by a deeper understanding of the causes of species turnover patterns, together with work on the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem function and services. Biodiversity conservation in the region is becoming increasingly embedded within a more multi-functional view of agriculture-forest mosaics that attempts to recognise and value the range of services provided by tree cover and other land-uses. This relatively new perspective has the potential, at least in principle, to re-shape the drivers of land-use change because tree cover can generate additional revenue through carbon trading or certification schemes. It will become clearer over the coming decades whether this potential can be realised, but the implications for biodiversity conservation in the region are potentially profound. The socio-economic processes that have driven forest loss and degradation in West Africa are having an increasing impact on the relatively undisturbed rainforest of the Congo Basin. We conclude by pointing out that while West African forest landscapes are a potent reminder of what might happen in Central Africa in the near future, they also provide insights for developing policies and practice that might avoid comparable levels of forest loss and degradation.},

The strategy consists of three questions that should be kept in mind when communicating about stability properties. These three questions should overcome the three main sources of confusion in terminology. Firstly, which stability properties are being addressed in the stability statement? Our analysis shows that the general term ''stability'' is so ambiguous as to be useless.It can be replaced by the stability properties ''staying essentially unchanged'' (constancy), ''returning to the reference state (or dynamic) after a temporary disturbance'' (resilience), and ''persistence through time of an ecological system'' (persistence). Second, to what ecological situation does the statement refer? An ecological situation is defined by a set of features that, taken as a whole, determine the domain of validity of a stability statement. The six most important features form the ''ecological checklist'', which serves to classify ecological situations and thereby provides a system of coordinates for communication. The six points are: variable of interest, level of description, reference state, disturbance, spatial scale and temporal scale. Thirdly, is the statement anchored in the situation in question, or is there unacceptable generalisation by inferring ''stability'' of the whole system from a certain stability property in a certain ecological ecological situation? This question separates the scientifically valuable content of a statement from the desire for general statements which is often projected through stability statements.},

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDMuch of ecological theory and the understanding of ecological systems has been based on the idea that the observed states and dynamics of ecological systems can be represented by stable asymptotic behavior of models describing these systems. Beginning with early work by Lotka and Volterra through the seminal work of May in the 1970s, this view has dominated much of ecological thinking, although concepts such as the idea of tipping points in ecological systems have played an increasingly important role. In contrast to the implied long time scales of asymptotic behavior in mathematical models, both observations of ecological systems and questions related to the management of ecological systems are typically focused on relatively short time scales.A number of models and observations demonstrate possible transient behavior that may persist over very long time periods, followed by rapid changes in dynamics. In these examples, focusing solely on the long-term behavior of systems would be misleading. A long transient is a persistent dynamical regime\textemdash{}including near-constant dynamics, cyclic dynamics, or even apparently chaotic dynamics\textemdash{}that persists for more than a few and as many as tens of generations, but which is not the stable long-term dynamic that would eventually occur. These examples have demonstrated the potential importance of transients but have often appeared to be a set of idiosyncratic cases. What is needed is an organized approach that describes when a transient behavior is likely to appear, predicts what factors enhance long transients, and describes the characteristics of this transient behavior. A theory of long ecological transients is a counterpart to the related question of tipping points, where previous work based on an analysis of simple bifurcations has provided broad insights.
ADVANCESJust as ideas based on the saddle-node bifurcation provide a basis for understanding tipping points, a suite of ideas from dynamical systems provides a way to organize a systematic study of transient dynamics in ecological systems. As illustrated in the figure, a relatively small number of ideas from dynamical systems are used to categorize the different ways that transients can arise. Translating these abstract results from dynamical systems into observations about both ecological models and ecological system dynamics, it is possible to understand when transients are likely to occur and the various properties of these transients, with implications for ecosystem management and basic ecological theory. Transients can provide an explanation for observed regime shifts that does not depend on underlying environmental changes. Systems that continually change rapidly between different long-lasting dynamics, such as insect outbreaks, may most usefully be viewed using the framework of long transients.An initial focus on conceptual systems, such as two-species systems, establishes the ubiquity of transients and an understanding of what ecological aspects can lead to transients, including the presence of multiple time scales and particular nonlinear interactions. The influences of stochasticity and more realistic higher-dimensional dynamics are shown to increase the likelihood, and possibly the temporal extent, of transient dynamics.
OUTLOOKThe development of such a framework for organizing the study of transients in ecological systems opens up a number of avenues for future research and application. The approach we describe also raises important questions for further development in dynamical systems. We have not, for example, emphasized nonautonomous systems, which may be required to understand the implications of a changing environment for transients. Systems with explicit time dependence as well as stochastic nonlinear systems still present great mathematical challenges.Implications for management and basic ecological understanding depend on both the results we describe and future developments. A recognition of the difficulty of prediction caused by long transients, and of the corresponding need to match dynamics to transient behaviors of models, shows that basing either management or interpretation of ecological observations only on long-term dynamics can be seriously flawed. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6406/eaat6412/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Two ways that long transients arise in ecology, illustrated as a ball rolling downhill.(A) Slow transition away from a ghost attractor: a state that is not an equilibrium, but would be under slightly different conditions. (B) Lingering near a saddle: a state that is attracting from some directions but repelling from others. Additional factors such as stochasticity, multiple time scales, and high system dimension can extend transients.
The importance of transient dynamics in ecological systems and in the models that describe them has become increasingly recognized. However, previous work has typically treated each instance of these dynamics separately. We review both empirical examples and model systems, and outline a classification of transient dynamics based on ideas and concepts from dynamical systems theory. This classification provides ways to understand the likelihood of transients for particular systems, and to guide investigations to determine the timing of sudden switches in dynamics and other characteristics of transients. Implications for both management and underlying ecological theories emerge.},

Recent work has focused mainly on the impact of species diversity within single trophic levels, both experimentally and theoretically. Experiments have usually showed increased plant biomass and productivity with increasing plant diversity. Changes in biodiversity, however, may affect ecosystem processes through trophic interactions among species as well. An important current challenge is to understand how these trophic interactions affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here we present a mechanistic model of an ecosystem with multiple trophic levels in which plants compete for a limiting soil nutrient. In contrast to previous studies that focused on single trophic levels, we show that plant biomass does not always increase with plant diversity and that changes in biodiversity can lead to complex if predictable changes in ecosystem processes. Our analysis demonstrates that food-web structure can profoundly influence ecosystem properties.},

  abstract = {The success of a biological invasion is context dependent, and yet two key concepts\textemdash{}the invasiveness of species and the invasibility of recipient ecosystems\textemdash{}are often defined and considered separately. We propose a framework that can elucidate the complex relationship between invasibility and invasiveness. It is based on trait-mediated interactions between species and depicts the response of an ecological network to the intrusion of an alien species, drawing on the concept of community saturation. Here, invasiveness of an introduced species with a particular trait is measured by its per capita population growth rate when the initial propagule pressure of the introduced species is very low. The invasibility of the recipient habitat or ecosystem is dependent on the structure of the resident ecological network and is defined as the total width of an opportunity niche in the trait space susceptible to invasion. Invasibility is thus a measure of network instability. We also correlate invasibility with the asymptotic stability of resident ecological network, measured by the leading eigenvalue of the interaction matrix that depicts trait-based interaction intensity multiplied by encounter rate (a pairwise product of propagule pressure of all members in a community). We further examine the relationship between invasibility and network architecture, including network connectance, nestedness and modularity. We exemplify this framework with a trait-based assembly model under perturbations in ways to emulate fluctuating resources and random trait composition in ecological networks. The maximum invasiveness of a potential invader (greatest intrinsic population growth rate) was found to be positively correlated with invasibility of the recipient ecological network. Additionally, ecosystems with high network modularity and high ecological stability tend to exhibit high invasibility. Where quantitative data are lacking we propose using a qualitative interaction matrix of the ecological network perceived by a potential invader so that the structural network stability and invasibility can be estimated from the literature or from expert opinion. This approach links network structure, invasiveness and invasibility in the context of trait-mediated interactions, such as the invasion of insects into mutualistic and antagonistic networks.},

May analysed large networks in which species interact at random1,2,6. However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-defined interactions (for example predator\textendash{}prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May's results to these relationships and find remarkable differences between predator\textendash{}prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and mutualistic and competitive interactions, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. We use the criteria to prove that, counterintuitively, the probability of stability for predator\textendash{}prey networks decreases when a realistic food web structure is imposed7,8 or if there is a large preponderance of weak interactions9,10. Similarly, stability is negatively affected by nestedness11,12,13,14 in bipartite mutualistic networks. These results are found by separating the contribution of network structure and interaction strengths to stability. Stable predator\textendash{}prey networks can be arbitrarily large and complex, provided that predator\textendash{}prey pairs are tightly coupled. The stability criteria are widely applicable, because they hold for any system of differential equations.},

When it is impractical to measure these parameters, one may choose random parameter values and study the emergent statistical properties at the system level. Many influential results in theoretical ecology have been derived from two key assumptions: that species interact with random partners at random intensities and that intraspecific competition is comparable between species. Under these assumptions, community dynamics can be described by a community matrix that is often amenable to mathematical analysis. We combine empirical data with mathematical theory to show that both of these assumptions lead to results that must be interpreted with caution. We examine 21 empirically derived community matrices constructed using three established, independent methods. The empirically derived systems are more stable by orders of magnitude than results from random matrices. This consistent disparity is not explained by existing results on predator-prey interactions. We investigate the key properties of empirical community matrices that distinguish them from random matrices. We show that network topology is less important than the relationship between a species' trophic position within the food web and its interaction strengths. We identify key features of empirical networks that must be preserved if random matrix models are to capture the features of real ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A dilemma in ecology Ecologists aspire to build a discipline to both understand the natural world and to provide society with tools to make responsible decisions about the environment. For both of these purposes, most sciences have, at their core, a set of empirical generalizations that predict the behaviour of important properties of nature (e.g., Newton's laws of mechanics, Mendeleev's periodic table, Mendel's genetics). Ecological science, in contrast, has favoured studies to understand processes (competition, population regulation, etc. \textendash{} i.e., independent variables) rather than models that predict attributes of nature (dependent variables). Classical reductionist scientific training emphasizes studies of mechanisms under controlled experimental conditions. Yet, inferences about nature from experiments are nearly always unjustifiable extrapolations beyond the experimental conditions. Mechanisms that are statistically detectable in experimental systems may contribute very little to the variation of nature. Studies of ecological processes in isolation may contribute to ``expert understanding,'' but experts have been shown to be poor predictors of the behaviour of natural systems. A proposed solution The more relevant, often neglected question is: what factors can statistically account for the observed variance of nature? A more Newtonian approach to ecology would: (a) first, specify the properties of nature (i.e., dependent variables) whose variance is of concern; (b) develop models that statistically capture the variance of those properties in nature; (c) demonstrate that those models can predict independent data; and, only last, (d) experimentally test hypotheses about processes that could give rise to the predictable patterns in nature. Why it matters Successful disciplines identify specific goals and measure progress toward those goals. Predictive accuracy of properties of nature is a measure of that progress in ecology. Predictive accuracy is the objective evidence of understanding. It is the most useful tool that science can offer society.},

This is difficult, because whole-community data are limited and typically comprise only a snapshot of a community instead of a time series of dynamics, and mathematical models of complex system dynamics have a large number of unmeasured parameters and therefore have been only tenuously related to real systems. These are related problems, because long time-series, if they were commonly available, would enable inference of parameters. The resulting `plague of parameters' means most studies of multi-species population dynamics have been very theoretical. Dynamical models parametrized using physiological allometries may offer a partial cure for the plague of parameters, and these models are increasingly used in theoretical studies. However, physiological allometries cannot determine all parameters, and the models have also rarely been directly tested against data. We confronted a model of community dynamics with data from a lake community. Many important empirical patterns were reproducible as outcomes of dynamics, and were not reproducible when parameters did not follow physiological allometries. Results validate the usefulness, when parameters follow physiological allometries, of classic differential-equation models for understanding whole-community dynamics and the structure\textendash{}dynamics relationship.},

The components of a general theory of ecology have existed for the past half century; ecologists simply have failed to explicitly recognize them. We present a general theory of ecology and show how it relates to ecology's numerous constituent theories and models. The general theory consists of a description of the domain of ecology and a set of fundamental principles. The domain of ecology is the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution and abundance of organisms, including causes and consequences. Fundamental principles are broad statements about the patterns that exist and the processes that operate within a domain. The seven fundamental principles of the theory of ecology are: the heterogeneous distribution of organisms, interactions of organisms, contingency, environmental heterogeneity, finite and heterogeneous resources, the mortality of organisms, and the evolutionary cause of ecological properties. These principles are the necessary and sufficient elements for a general theory of ecology. The propositions of any constituent theory of ecology can be shown to be a consequence of these fundamental principles along with principles from other science domains. The general theory establishes relationships among constituent theories through shared fundamental principles. The next challenge is to develop and integrate unified, constituent theories and to establish the relationships among them within the framework established by the general theory.},

We prove that under biologically relevant conditions every model allowing for coexistence of infinitely many strategies is structurally unstable. In particular, this is the case when the ``interaction operator'' which determines how the growth rate of a strategy depends on the strategy distribution of the population is compact. The interaction operator is not assumed to be linear. We investigate a Lotka-Volterra competition model with a linear interaction operator of convolution type separately because the convolution operator is not compact. For this model, we exclude the possibility of robust coexistence supported on the whole real line, or even on a set containing a limit point. Moreover, we exclude coexistence of an infinite set of equidistant strategies when the total population size is finite. On the other hand, for infinite populations it is possible to have robust coexistence in this case. These results are in line with the ecological concept of ``limiting similarity'' of coexisting species. We conclude that the mathematical structure of the ecological coexistence problem itself dictates the discreteness of the species.},

Instead, we start from a set of possible species, which may undergo extinction. How many species survive depends on the properties of the interaction matrix; the size of the resulting food web at stationarity is a property of the system itself in our model, and not a control parameter as in most studies based on random matrix theory. We find that prey-predator relations enhance stability, and that variability of species interactions promotes instability. Complexity of inter-species couplings leads to reduced sizes of ecological communities. Dynamically evolved community size and stability are hence positively correlated.}

Similar random matrix models have since been applied in many disciplines. Central to assessing stability is the ``circular law'' since it describes the eigenvalue distribution for an important class of random matrices A. However, despite widespread adoption, the ``circular law'' does not apply for ecological systems in which density-dependence operates (i.e., where a species growth is determined by its density). Instead one needs to study the far more complicated eigenvalue distribution of the community matrix S\,=\,DA, where D is a diagonal matrix of population equilibrium values. Here we obtain this eigenvalue distribution. We show that if the random matrix A is locally stable, the community matrix S\,=\,DA will also be locally stable, providing the system is feasible (i.e., all species have positive equilibria D\,{$>$}\,0). This helps explain why, unusually, nearly all feasible systems studied here are locally stable. Large complex systems may thus be even more fragile than May predicted, given the difficulty of assembling a feasible system. It was also found that the degree of stability, or resilience of a system, depended on the minimum equilibrium population.},

It has generated predictions that are either practically untestable, by virtue of unmeasurable parameters or unrealizable assumptions, or trivially true. Whether or not it has influenced a productive set of investigators of natural systems is debatable, but such influences are not explicit in the writings of most such investigators. On the other hand, the theory has caused a generation of ecologists to waste a monumental amount of time. However, specific investigations, usually experimental, of well-defined field systems have in a gradual and hierarchical way told us quite a bit about how nature works and about the role of interspecific competition among plant and animal populations. These investigations are strongly in the hypothesis-testing tradition, but rather than testing general theory they test specific predictions about specific systems, and they seem to arise as much out of intense curiosity about these systems as out of a desire to find general laws or patterns of nature. As a group, these investigations suggest that competitive exclusion of one species by another is exceptional and that more frequently species sharing resources either do not affect one another or contrive to coexist with changes less drastic than local extinction. When species do compete with one another, effects are usually moderated by other factors (e.g., weather, predators, pathogens) that keep populations below levels at which exclusion would occur, or else each competitor is favored in a different set of times and/or places and this fact combined with normal individual movements keep all species in the system. Interspecific competition is as likely to be by interference as by exploitation, and is frequently affected by biological idiosyncrasies of the individual species. Chance plays a major role in many potentially competitive interactions, and there is good evidence that many species that do compete with one another do so rarely or intermittently, and at most times their population dynamics are governed by other forces.]},

  abstract = {Ecology is in a challenging state as a scientific discipline. While some theoretical ecologists are attempting to build a definition of ecology from first principles, many others are questioning even the feasibility of a general and universal theory. At the same time, it is increasingly important that ecology is accurately and functionally defined for a generation of researchers tackling escalating environmental problems in the face of doubt and disagreement. The authors of Theory-Based Ecology have written a textbook that presents a robust, modern, and mathematically sound theory of ecology, maintaining a strong link between empirical data, models, and theory. It is firmly based in Darwinian thought, since it was Darwin who first revealed the ecological principles of the origin of species, and gave the evolution of diversity a process-based, mechanistic explanation.The authors base their synthetic theory of Darwinian ecology on seven key principles: exponential growth, growth regulation, inherited individual differences, finiteness and stochasticity, competitive exclusion, robust coexistence, and constraints and trade-offs. Within this solid conceptual framework, they integrate classic and actual empirical knowledge from ecology and evolutionary biology, clarifying methodological and mathematical detail in clear and helpful text boxes. A wealth of illustrated examples pertaining to different organisational levels (alleles, clones and species) helps to explain how the principles operate.This is an invaluable resource for graduate level students as well as professional researchers in the fields of ecology, genetics, evolutionary ecology, and mathematical biology.},

This relationship has similarly been assumed for the Baltic Sea, especially in areas with impaired status, but has also never been documented. Here we provide a first tentative indication that cumulative human impacts relate to ecosystem condition, i.e. biodiversity status, in the Baltic Sea. Thus, cumulative impact assessments offer a promising tool for informed marine spatial planning, designation of marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management, and may prove useful for setting limits on allowable levels of human impact on ecosystems.},

  abstract = {In population ecology, there has been a fundamental controversy about the relative importance of competition-driven (density-dependent) population regulation vs. abiotic influences such as temperature and precipitation. The same issue arises at the community level; are population sizes driven primarily by changes in the abundances of cooccurring competitors (i.e., compensatory dynamics), or do most species have a common response to environmental factors? Competitive interactions have had a central place in ecological theory, dating back to Gleason, Volterra, Hutchison and MacArthur, and, more recently, Hubbell's influential unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. If competitive interactions are important in driving year-to-year fluctuations in abundance, then changes in the abundance of one species should generally be accompanied by compensatory changes in the abundances of others. Thus, one necessary consequence of strong compensatory forces is that, on average, species within communities will covary negatively. Here we use measures of community covariance to assess the prevalence of negative covariance in 41 natural communities comprising different taxa at a range of spatial scales. We found that species in natural communities tended to covary positively rather than negatively, the opposite of what would be expected if compensatory dynamics were important. These findings suggest that abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation are more important than competitive interactions in driving year-to-year fluctuations in species abundance within communities.},

  abstract = {Many theoretical models of community dynamics predict that species richness (S) and total abundance (N) are regulated in their temporal fluctuations. We present novel evidence for widespread regulation of biodiversity. For 59 plant and animal assemblages from around the globe monitored annually for a decade or more, the majority exhibited regulated fluctuations compared to the null hypothesis of an unconstrained random walk. However, there was little evidence for statistical artifacts, regulation driven by correlations with average annual temperature, or local-scale compensatory fluctuations in S or N. In the absence of major environmental perturbations, such as urbanization or cropland transformation, species richness and abundance may be buffered and exhibit some resilience in their temporal trajectories. These results suggest that regulatory processes are occurring despite unprecedented environmental change, highlighting the need for community-level assessment of biodiversity trends, as well as extensions of existing theory to address open source pools and shifting environmental conditions.
Temporal fluctuations in species richness are frequently regulated, exhibiting a tendency to return toward a central level.

  title = {Two Complementary Paradigms for Analysing Population Dynamics},
  volume = {357},
  abstract = {To understand why population growth rate is sometimes positive and sometimes negative, ecologists have adopted two main approaches. The most common approach is through the density paradigm by plotting population growth rate against population density. The second approach is through the mechanistic paradigm by plotting population growth rate against the relevant ecological processes affecting the population. The density paradigm is applied a posteriori, works sometimes but not always and is remarkably useless in solving management problems or in providing an understanding of why populations change in size. The mechanistic paradigm investigates the factors that supposedly drive density changes and is identical to Caughley's declining population paradigm of conservation biology. The assumption that we can uncover invariant relationships between population growth rate and some other variables is an article of faith. Numerous commercial fishery applications have failed to find the invariant relationships between stock and recruitment that are predicted by the density paradigm. Environmental variation is the rule, and non\textendash{}equilibrial dynamics should force us to look for the mechanisms of population change. If multiple factors determine changes in population density, there can be no predictability in either of these paradigms and we will become environmental historians rather than scientists with useful generalizations for the population problems of this century. Defining our questions clearly and adopting an experimental approach with crisp alternative hypotheses and adequate controls will be essential to building useful generalizations for solving the practical problems of population management in fisheries, wildlife and conservation.},

  abstract = {The identification of what factors determine the population dynamics of polyvoltine species has been a difficult problem in ecology because population dynamics can contain intra- and interannual variability, and because the time scale at which factors affect the population is often unknown. We created a comprehensive population model to determine how density dependence (linear, nonlinear, and time-delayed) and weather affected the rate of population growth of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in an isolated woodlot. We studied this nonoutbreak, polyvoltine species using a 257-mo data set spanning 23 yr, which incorporated both detailed intra-annual and long-term dynamics, and we used this model to forecast future population size. We then evaluated whether 3-yr spans of monthly data or a 22-yr span of annual data were better able to identify the key determinants that drive population dynamics, and we identified which data type created more accurate forecasts. The 257-mo comprehensive model determined that the intra-annual cycle was caused by seasonally varying intrinsic growth rates and density dependence on a 1\textendash{}2 mo scale and indicated that peak population size in one year did not affect the population in the subsequent year. Interannual variability in peak and trough density was caused by the effect of weather on monthly rate of growth with a 0\textendash{}2 mo time delay, with the exception of two droughts. These droughts negatively affected the population for 9 mo; the effects were probably mediated through reduced seed crop. This model explained 81\% of the variability in density. Because weather determined interannual variability in density, forecasts that did not use known weather data during the forecast period were poor. When weather data were used, forecasts were accurate within 1\textendash{}3 animals (10\%) of observed densities up to 8 mo in the future but were inaccurate beyond 8 mo. We found that short-term monthly data detected more factors affecting the population and created more accurate forecasts than long-term annual data, because all factors affecting the population (except droughts) occurred on a monthly scale. The annual model did not detect any weather effects except droughts and detected annual density dependence, which represents time-delayed density dependence in polyvoltine species. We argue that this annual relationship is spurious and caused by studying this polyvoltine species on an inappropriate time scale. Our work suggests that the time scale of the analysis may affect the conclusions drawn about which types of factors determine population size and with what time lag. It also suggests that, even when population fluctuations can be explained, accurately predicting future densities may be impossible when fluctuations are driven by weather.},

We show that density-dependent regulation primarily occurs in winter months, so that populations experiencing longer winters tend to have a stronger delayed density-dependence and, as a result, exhibit regular density cycles.

We analyzed the feedback structure of these species using statistical time series models for spring and autumn abundances. All species showed a seasonal density-dependent structure, and in five of them first-order feedbacks were dominant in winter and summer. Instead, southern red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi) showed a different feedback structure during winter and summer. In three species (C. gapperi, Napaeozapus insignis and Peromyscus maniculatus), environmental factors were more important during summer, while the opposite pattern was found in Blarina brevicauda and Tamias striatus. Snowfall influenced positively the winter population growth rates of southern red-backed voles, white-footed mice, woodland jumping mice and eastern chipmunks. We found seasonal differences in the effects of the small mammals assemblage on population growth rates of the two Peromyscus species. The common feedback structure between seasons observed in most of the species, particularly among voles and mice, points to a different feedback structure from northern cyclic small mammals. We conclude that a seasonal feedback structure dominated by intra- and inter-specific competitive interactions may be at the basis of the population dynamics of these species.},

  abstract = {Strongly interacting, dynamically disordered and with no small parameter, liquids took a theoretical status between gases and solids with the historical tradition of hydrodynamic description as the starting point. We review different approaches to liquids as well as recent experimental and theoretical work, and propose that liquids do not need classifying in terms of their proximity to gases and solids or any categorizing for that matter. Instead, they are a unique system in their own class with a notably mixed dynamical state in contrast to pure dynamical states of solids and gases. We start with explaining how the first-principles approach to liquids is an intractable, exponentially complex problem of coupled non-linear oscillators with bifurcations. This is followed by a reduction of the problem based on liquid relaxation time {$\tau$} representing non-perturbative treatment of strong interactions. On the basis of {$\tau$}, solid-like high-frequency modes are predicted and we review related recent experiments. We demonstrate how the propagation of these modes can be derived by generalizing either hydrodynamic or elasticity equations. We comment on the historical trend to approach liquids using hydrodynamics and compare it to an alternative solid-like approach. We subsequently discuss how collective modes evolve with temperature and how this evolution affects liquid energy and heat capacity as well as other properties such as fast sound. Here, our emphasis is on understanding experimental data in real, rather than model, liquids. Highlighting the dominant role of solid-like high-frequency modes for liquid energy and heat capacity, we review a wide range of liquids: subcritical low-viscous liquids, supercritical state with two different dynamical and thermodynamic regimes separated by the Frenkel line, highly-viscous liquids in the glass transformation range and liquid-glass transition. We subsequently discuss the fairly recent area of liquid\textendash{}liquid phase transitions, the area where the solid-like properties of liquids have become further apparent. We then discuss gas-like and solid-like approaches to quantum liquids and theoretical issues that are similar to the classical case. Finally, we summarize the emergent view of liquids as a unique system with a mixed dynamical state, and list several areas where interesting insights may appear and continue the extraordinary liquid story.},

  abstract = {Future changes in precipitation regimes are likely to impact species richness in water-limited plant communities. Regional, spatial relationships between precipitation and richness could offer information about how altered rainfall will impact local communities, assuming that processes driving the regional relationship are also dominant at fine spatial and short temporal scales. To test this assumption, we compared spatial and temporal relationships between precipitation and both species richness and species turnover in central North American grasslands. Across a broad geographic gradient, mean plant species richness in 1-m2 plots increased significantly with mean annual precipitation. In contrast, over a 36-yr period at one mixed-grass prairie in the center of the regional gradient, single-year precipitation and richness were poorly correlated, and consecutive wet years had little effect on richness. Instead, richness increased most in wet years that followed dry years. Geographically dispersed sites receiving different levels of mean annual precipitation displayed strong differences in species composition, whereas temporal variation in precipitation at one site was not related to compositional dissimilarity, indicating that species turnover plays a key role in generating the regional relationship. Analyses of individual species' presence-absence suggest that the lagged temporal responses reflect environmental germination cues more than resource competition. These complex cues may dampen the initial impact of altered precipitation on diversity, but over the long term, turnover in species composition should lead to changes in richness, as in the regional, spatial relationship. How quickly this long-term response develops may depend on the colonization rates of species better adapted to the altered rainfall regime.},

For eight assemblages, ranging from lake zooplankton to desert rodents, this model outperformed a sampling-based model and two simpler models in which area and time had independent effects. In every case, the interaction term was negative, meaning that rates of species accumulation in space decreased with the time span of sampling, while species accumulation rates in time decreased with area sampled. Although questions remain about its precise functional form, the STAR provides a tool for scaling species richness across time and space, for comparing the relative rates of species turnover in space and time at different scales of sampling, and for rigorous testing of mechanisms proposed to drive community dynamics.

I used 35 years of data from permanent plots in Kansas grasslands to test the ability of strict and modified neutral models to reproduce observed species\textendash{}area and species\textendash{}time relationships (STRs). Holding species density to observed values, the models could generate realistic SARs or STRs, but not both simultaneously. Parameter combinations that simulated realistic STRs led to SARs with extremely steep slopes. To examine the consequences of relaxing neutrality, I incorporated plant functional types into the model. More realistic dominance produced only limited improvement in the simulated results, and indicates that the models' primary flaw is their failure to reproduce rapid but spatially correlated changes in species composition. In these grasslands, characterized by large interannual variation in resources and many short-lived species, functional differences among species play a strong role in driving macroscopic patterns. The results emphasize the need to test neutral models, and other dynamic community models, with spatiotemporal data.},

  abstract = {Abstract Habitat destruction is driving biodiversity loss in remaining ecosystems, and ecosystem functioning and services often directly depend on biodiversity. Thus, biodiversity loss is likely creating an ecosystem service debt: a gradual loss of biodiversity-dependent benefits that people obtain from remaining fragments of natural ecosystems. Here, we develop an approach for quantifying ecosystem service debts, and illustrate its use to estimate how one anthropogenic driver, habitat destruction, could indirectly diminish one ecosystem service, carbon storage, by creating an extinction debt. We estimate that c.~2?21 Pg C could be gradually emitted globally in remaining ecosystem fragments because of plant species loss caused by nearby habitat destruction. The wide range for this estimate reflects substantial uncertainties in how many plant species will be lost, how much species loss will impact ecosystem functioning and whether plant species loss will decrease soil carbon. Our exploratory analysis suggests that biodiversity-dependent ecosystem service debts can be globally substantial, even when locally small, if they occur diffusely across vast areas of remaining ecosystems. There is substantial value in conserving not only the quantity (area), but also the quality (biodiversity) of natural ecosystems for the sustainable provision of ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Although empirical support for it is at an early stage of development, metacommunity theory has become a mainstream component in ecological thinking. Four paradigms encapsulate proposed metacommunity mechanisms: (1) colonization\textendash{}competition trade-off in ``patch dynamics,'' (2) community-dependent species\textendash{}environment fitting in ``species sorting,'' (3) increase in local persistence through immigration from more successful populations in the ``mass effect,'' and (4) trait-independent assemblages of ``neutral processes.'' Using metapopulation models, we highlight the wide range of patterns predicted by different mechanisms. Neutral and mass effects should be enhanced by dispersal, thereby constraining the conditions for species sorting. The relative effects of dispersal on dominant and subordinate species determine the weakening or strengthening of patch dynamics. Potential methodological approaches to field-data evaluation of metacommunity theoretical predictions are considered here. The key difference among paradigms lies in the putative role of traits on species performance in different communities. We argue for the use of functional biodiversity analyses by maximum entropy (MaxEnt) procedures as powerful tools for distinguishing metacommunity mechanisms. The effect of dispersal on metacommunity mechanisms also requires realistic field-testing. The centrality\textendash{}isolation gradient may directly determine dispersal, while graph theory provides measures of isolation and network structure; nevertheless, estimation of metacommunity networks is not straightforward. Percolation distances, minimum spanning trees, and physical connections between patches are excellent approaches toward this problem of estimation, but the configurations they describe may differ from the functional metacommunity network. We propose an estimation method based on maximization of network\textendash{}local pattern coherence, and we consider further alternatives. The combined use of MaxEnt and graph theories will likely contribute significantly to advances in metacommunity concepts through rigorous validations based on field-collected data.},

Science, this issue p. eaai9214
Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDThe success of human societies depends intimately on the living components of natural and managed systems. Although the geographical range limits of species are dynamic and fluctuate over time, climate change is impelling a universal redistribution of life on Earth. For marine, freshwater, and terrestrial species alike, the first response to changing climate is often a shift in location, to stay within preferred environmental conditions. At the cooler extremes of their distributions, species are moving poleward, whereas range limits are contracting at the warmer range edge, where temperatures are no longer tolerable. On land, species are also moving to cooler, higher elevations; in the ocean, they are moving to colder water at greater depths. Because different species respond at different rates and to varying degrees, key interactions among species are often disrupted, and new interactions develop. These idiosyncrasies can result in novel biotic communities and rapid changes in ecosystem functioning, with pervasive and sometimes unexpected consequences that propagate through and affect both biological and human communities.
ADVANCESAt a time when the world is anticipating unprecedented increases in human population growth and demands, the ability of natural ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services is being challenged by the largest climate-driven global redistribution of species since the Last Glacial Maximum. We demonstrate the serious consequences of this species redistribution for economic development, livelihoods, food security, human health, and culture, and we document feedbacks on climate itself. As with other impacts of climate change, species range shifts will leave ``winners'' and ``losers'' in their wake, radically reshaping the pattern of human well-being between regions and different sectors and potentially leading to substantial conflict. The pervasive impacts of changes in species distribution transcend single systems or dimensions, with feedbacks and linkages between multiple interacting scales and through whole ecosystems, inclusive of humans. We argue that the negative effects of climate change cannot be adequately anticipated or prepared for unless species responses are explicitly included in decision-making and global strategic frameworks.
OUTLOOKDespite mounting evidence for the pervasive and substantial impacts of a climate-driven redistribution of Earth's species, current global goals, policies, and international agreements fail to account for these effects. With the predicted intensification of species movements and their diverse societal and environmental impacts, awareness of species ``on the move'' should be incorporated into local, regional, and global assessments as standard practice. This will raise hope that future targets\textemdash{}whether they be global sustainability goals, plans for regional biodiversity maintenance, or local fishing or forestry harvest strategies\textemdash{}can be achievable and that society is prepared for a world of universal ecological change. Human society has yet to appreciate the implications of unprecedented species redistribution for life on Earth, including for human lives. Even if greenhouse gas emissions stopped today, the responses required in human systems to adapt to the most serious effects of climate-driven species redistribution would be massive. Meeting these challenges requires governance that can anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, as well as minimize negative consequences. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/355/6332/eaai9214/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint As the global climate changes, human well-being, ecosystem function, and even climate itself are increasingly affected by the shifting geography of life.Climate-driven changes in species distributions, or range shifts, affect human well-being both directly (for example, through emerging diseases and changes in food supply) and indirectly (by degrading ecosystem health). Some range shifts even create feedbacks (positive or negative) on the climate system, altering the pace of climate change.
Distributions of Earth's species are changing at accelerating rates, increasingly driven by human-mediated climate change. Such changes are already altering the composition of ecological communities, but beyond conservation of natural systems, how and why does this matter? We review evidence that climate-driven species redistribution at regional to global scales affects ecosystem functioning, human well-being, and the dynamics of climate change itself. Production of natural resources required for food security, patterns of disease transmission, and processes of carbon sequestration are all altered by changes in species distribution. Consideration of these effects of biodiversity redistribution is critical yet lacking in most mitigation and adaptation strategies, including the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.},

In theoretical physics, there is a burst of research activity in analyzing large fluctuations in stochastic population dynamics.

Although species have responded to climatic changes throughout their evolutionary history2, a primary concern for wild species and their ecosystems is this rapid rate of change3. We gathered information on species and global warming from 143 studies for our meta-analyses. These analyses reveal a consistent temperature-related shift, or `fingerprint', in species ranging from molluscs to mammals and from grasses to trees. Indeed, more than 80\% of the species that show changes are shifting in the direction expected on the basis of known physiological constraints of species. Consequently, the balance of evidence from these studies strongly suggests that a significant impact of global warming is already discernible in animal and plant populations. The synergism of rapid temperature rise and other stresses, in particular habitat destruction, could easily disrupt the connectedness among species and lead to a reformulation of species communities, reflecting differential changes in species, and to numerous extirpations and possibly extinctions.},

This barrier effect has negative demographic and genetic consequences that can ultimately result in local or regional extinction. Here we use radio-telemetry data on three terrestrial vertebrates (eastern massasauga Sistrurus catenatus, eastern box turtle Terrapene carolina and ornate box turtle Terrapene ornata) to test whether roads acted as barriers to movement. Specifically, we test whether individuals avoided crossing roads by comparing the number of observed crossings with the number of road crossings predicted by randomizations of individual movement paths. All species crossed roads significantly less often than predicted by chance, indicating strong road avoidance. Results of this study showing behavioral avoidance and previous studies on road mortality indicate that roads are strong barriers to these species. High mortality during crossing attempts would select for road avoidance, reducing the number of individuals killed on roads over time but leading to genetically partitioned subpopulations due to a lack of gene flow. In species that are long-lived and late-maturing, negative genetic effects might not be observable over short time-scales, thus placing populations at high risk of extinction because of a failure to detect an incrementally worsening problem. Formulating successful management strategies for many species in decline will require integrating data on road mortality, animal behavior and population genetics in order to understand more clearly the barrier effect of roads.},

  abstract = {Metacommunity theory has advanced understanding of how spatial dynamics and local interactions shape community structure and biodiversity. Here, we review empirical approaches to metacommunities, both observational and experimental, pertaining to how well they relate to and test theoretical metacommunity paradigms and how well they capture the realities of natural ecosystems. First, we show that the species-sorting and mass-effects paradigms are the most commonly tested and supported paradigms. Second, the dynamics observed can often be ascribed to two or more of the four non-exclusive paradigms. Third, empirical approaches relate only weakly to the concise assumptions and predictions made by the paradigms. Consequently, we suggest major avenues of improvement for empirical metacommunity approaches, including the integration across theoretical approaches and the incorporation of evolutionary and meta-ecosystem dynamics. We hope for metacommunity ecology to thereby bridge existing gaps between empirical and theoretical work, thus becoming a more powerful framework to understand dynamics across ecosystems.},

These methods are widely used for numerical simulations in solid mechanics, electromagnetism, flow in porous media, etc., on parallel machines from tens to hundreds of thousands of cores. The appealing feature of domain decomposition methods is that, contrary to direct methods, they are naturally parallel. The authors focus on parallel linear solvers. The authors present all popular algorithms, both at the PDE level and at the discrete level in terms of matrices, along with systematic scripts for sequential implementation in a free open-source finite element package as well as some parallel scripts. Also included is a new coarse space construction (two-level method) that adapts to highly heterogeneous problems.{$\div$}},

Notable among these is the observation5 that in large assemblages there are more rare species than the log normal model predicts6,7. Here we use a long-term (21-year) data set, from an estuarine fish community, to show how an ecological community can be separated into two components. Core species, which are persistent, abundant and biologically associated with estuarine habitats, are log normally distributed. Occasional species occur infrequently in the record, are typically low in abundance and have different habitat requirements; they follow a log series distribution. These distributions are overlaid, producing the negative skew that characterizes real data sets.},

We subsequently formulate a theory of system thermodynamics above the crossover, and find good agreement between calculated and experimental specific heat with no free-fitting parameters. In this theory, energy and heat capacity are governed by the minimal length of the longitudinal mode in the system only, and do not explicitly depend on system-specific structure and interactions. We derive a power law and analyse supercritical scaling exponents in the system above the Frenkel line.},

We investigate the influence of migration on the stability of local networks to perturbation, and simulate a 5 \texttimes{} 5 spatial arrangement of cells, demonstrating that combining adaptive migration and heterogeneous habitats allows distinct food webs to coevolve from the beginning of the simulation. When coupling food webs by diffusion migration after an initial period of isolation, the Webworld model can construct metacommunities of distinct food webs if the local sites have spatially-homogeneous environmental parameters. If the sites have heterogeneous parameters, synchronisation between food webs increases greatly, but this can be offset by a greater number of sites and less-connected spatial topologies.},

The species that inhabit the patches interact with each other through a foodweb, the network of feeding interactions.

Previous work on meta-foodwebs has focussed on landscape networks that do not have an explicit spatial embedding, but in real landscapes the patches are usually distributed in space. Here we compare the dispersal of a meta-foodweb on Erd{\H o}s-R{\'e}nyi networks, that do not have a spatial embedding, and random geometric networks, that do have a spatial embedding. We found that local structure and large network distances in spatially embedded networks, lead to meso-scale patterns of patch occupation by both specialist and omnivorous species. In particular, we found that spatial separations make the coexistence of competing species more likely. Our results highlight the effects of spatial embeddings for meta-foodweb models, and the need for new analytical approaches to them.},

  shorttitle = {Biotic Interactions in Species Distribution Modelling},
  abstract = {Aim Recent studies increasingly use statistical methods to infer biotic interactions from co-occurrence information at a large spatial scale. However, disentangling biotic interactions from other factors that can affect co-occurrence patterns at the macroscale is a major challenge. Approach We present a set of questions that analysts and reviewers should ask to avoid erroneously attributing species association patterns to biotic interactions. Our questions relate to the appropriateness of data and models, the causality behind a correlative signal, and the problems associated with static data from dynamic systems. We summarize caveats reported by macroecological studies of biotic interactions and examine whether conclusions on the presence of biotic interactions are supported by the modelling approaches used. Findings Irrespective of the method used, studies that set out to test for biotic interactions find statistical associations in species' co-occurrences. Yet, when compared with our list of questions, few purported interpretations of such associations as biotic interactions hold up to scrutiny. This does not dismiss the presence or importance of biotic interactions, but it highlights the risk of too lenient interpretation of the data. Combining model results with information from experiments and functional traits that are relevant for the biotic interaction of interest might strengthen conclusions. Main conclusions Moving from species- to community-level models, including biotic interactions among species, is of great importance for process-based understanding and forecasting ecological responses. We hope that our questions will help to improve these models and facilitate the interpretation of their results. In essence, we conclude that ecologists have to recognize that a species association pattern in joint species distribution models will be driven not only by real biotic interactions, but also by shared habitat preferences, common migration history, phylogenetic history and shared response to missing environmental drivers, which specifically need to be discussed and, if possible, integrated into models.},

However, while neutral theory in well-mixed ecosystems is mathematically well understood, spatial models still present several open problems, limiting the quantitative understanding of spatial biodiversity. In this review, we discuss the state of the art in spatial neutral theory. We emphasize the connection between spatial ecological models and the physics of non-equilibrium phase transitions and how concepts developed in statistical physics translate in population dynamics, and vice versa. We focus on non-trivial scaling laws arising at the critical dimension D = 2D=2D = 2 of spatial neutral models, and their relevance for biological populations inhabiting two-dimensional environments. We conclude by discussing models incorporating non-neutral effects in the form of spatial and temporal disorder, and analyze how their predictions deviate from those of purely neutral theories.},

  abstract = {The structure of space has an appreciable influence on the diversity and stability of ecosystems. So far, there are only few theoretical studies investigating the population dynamics of food webs consisting of many species that can migrate between several patches, and in most of these models migration is a continuous, deterministic process. However, when migration events are rare (for instance because the patches are far apart), migration is a stochastic process and should be modeled accordingly. We present computer simulations of a food web model of many species on a spatial network of several patches, combining deterministic local population dynamics with stochastic migration. We evaluate the influence of the migration rate and other model parameters on local and regional species diversity and on stability. We find that migration increases the number of surviving and coexisting populations by two effects. These are the rescue effect, which restores local populations that have gone extinct, and dynamical coexistence, which sustains local populations that could not persist in the absence of immigration. Both effects occur even when migration events are rare. Species diversity increases on local and regional scales with the frequency of migration events. Furthermore, we investigate the adiabatic limit in which population dynamics always reaches an equilibrium before the next migration event, and we investigate the possible long-term scenarios. While the final state often contains the same food web on all patches, we also find instances where two slightly different food webs coexist on different patches, even when initially each patch contained the same food web.},

Rather than address each pattern in isolation, we propose that they must be understood together, calling for synthesis in a fragmented landscape of theoretical and empirical results. As a first step, we propose a minimal theory that combines the long-standing energetic and dynamical approaches of food chains. We chart theoretical predictions on a concise map, where two main regimes emerge: across various functioning and stability metrics, one regime is characterised by pyramidal patterns and the other by cascade patterns. The axes of this map combine key physiological and ecological variables, such as metabolic rates and self-regulation. A quantitative comparison with data sheds light on conflicting theoretical predictions and empirical puzzles, from size spectra to causes of trophic cascade strength. We conclude that drawing systematic connections between various existing approaches to food chains, and between their predictions on functioning and stability, is a crucial step in confronting this theory to real ecosystems.},

The bloom was dominated by the harmful algae haptophyte Phaeocystis cf. globosa and caused a very significant mortality of aquacultured fish and other marine life. In the same period, sea surface temperature (SST) imagery showed a cold water plume extending from the coast to the open sea, and QuikScat data showed strong southwesterly winds blowing parallel to the coastline. This study indicated that the HAB was induced and supported by offshore upwelling that brings nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface and from coastal water to offshore water and that the upwelling was driven by strong wind through Ekman transport when winds were parallel to the coastline. This study demonstrated the possibility of utilizing a combination of satellite data of Chl a, SST, and wind velocity together with coastal bathymetric information and in situ observations to give a better understanding of the biological oceanography of HABs.},

These questions have increasingly been answered through mechanistic and stochastic modeling efforts that rely on historical information about HABs in a given system for development, validation, and calibration. Therefore, understanding processes that control HABs is predicated on the ability to answer much more basic questions about what has actually occurred in a given system, namely questions of HAB occurrence, extent, intensity, and timing. Here we explore the state of the science in answering these basic questions; we use Lake Erie as a case study, where nearly two decades after the resurgence of HABs, a summer 2014 event caused a mandatory three day tap water ban for Toledo, Ohio. We find that, even for well-studied systems, unambiguous answers to basic questions about HAB occurrence are lacking, raising concerns about their use as a basis for addressing mechanistic questions about controlling factors. This ambiguity is found to be caused by differences in the methods used to track HABs, the specific harm being considered, the linkage to that harm (direct or indirect), the threshold defining harm, and spatiotemporal variability in sampling. Further work is therefore needed to integrate heterogeneous types of observations in order to better leverage existing and future monitoring programs, and to guide modeling efforts toward deeper understanding of HAB causes and consequences.},

During 1998 there were several particularly serious blooms in the coastal waters of south China, which caused a serious damage to aquaculture. We report a massive dinoflagellate bloom near the mouth of Pearl River in November 1998 with analyses of data from both in situ sea water measurements and satellites. A multi-parameter environmental mapping system was used to obtain real-time measurements of water quality properties and wind data through the algal bloom area, which allow us to compare water measurements from inside and outside of the bloom areas. This bloom with high concentrations of algal cells was evident as a series of red colored parallel bands of surface water that were 100\textendash{}300m long and 10\textendash{}30m wide with a total area of about 20\textendash{}30km2 by visual. The algal density reached 3.8\texttimes{}107cellsl-1 and the surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration was high. The algal species has been identified as Gymnodinium cf. catenatum Graham. The water column in the bloom area was stratified, where the surface temperature was 24\textendash{}25\textdegree{}C, the salinity was 18\textendash{}20\%, and the northern wind was about 3\textendash{}4ms-1 in the bloom area.

The two groups of students have different ways of learning material and often have strong negative feelings toward the area of knowledge that they find difficult. To give students a sense of mastery in each area, several complementary approaches are used in the course: 1) a ``live'' textbook that allows students to explore models and mathematical processes interactively; 2) benchmark problems providing key skills on which students make continuous progress; 3) assignment of students to teams of two throughout the semester; 4) regular one-on-one interactions with instructors throughout the semester; and 5) a term project in which students reconstruct, analyze, extend, and then write in detail about a recently published biological model. Based on student evaluations and comments, an attitude survey, and the quality of the students' term papers, the course has significantly increased the ability and willingness of biology students to use mathematical concepts and modeling tools to understand biological systems, and it has significantly enhanced engineering students' appreciation of biology.},

Poor notation can impede communication and understanding of ideas, and make models appear more complicated than necessary. Here, we present some guidelines, including: (a) define every term in an equation, (b) use fonts appropriately (italicise mathematical symbols, use bold lower case for vectors and bold upper case for matrices), (c) use subscripts appropriately (to index quantities, for example, by year), (d) use superscripts appropriately (to indicate a power, the transpose of a matrix or the steady-state value of a quantity), (e) avoid multiletter variable names, and (f) revisit notation early on in a project to see if it should be refined.

  volume = {52},

  abstract = {1. Faced with widespread degradation of riverine ecosystems, stream restoration has greatly increased. Such restoration is rarely planned and executed with inputs from ecological theory. In this paper, we seek to identify principles from ecological theory that have been, or could be, used to guide stream restoration. 2. In attempts to re-establish populations, knowledge of the species' life history, habitat template and spatio-temporal scope is critical. In many cases dispersal will be a critical process in maintaining viable populations at the landscape scale, and special attention should be given to the unique geometry of stream systems 3. One way by which organisms survive natural disturbances is by the use of refugia, many forms of which may have been lost with degradation. Restoring refugia may therefore be critical to survival of target populations, particularly in facilitating resilience to ongoing anthropogenic disturbance regimes. 4. Restoring connectivity, especially longitudinal connectivity, has been a major restoration goal. In restoring lateral connectivity there has been an increasing awareness of the riparian zone as a critical transition zone between streams and their catchments. 5. Increased knowledge of food web structure \textendash{} bottom-up versus top-down control, trophic cascades and subsidies \textendash{} are yet to be applied to stream restoration efforts. 6. In restoration, species are drawn from the regional species pool. Having overcome dispersal and environmental constraints (filters), species persistence may be governed by local internal dynamics, which are referred to as assembly rules. 7. While restoration projects often define goals and endpoints, the succession pathways and mechanisms (e.g. facilitation) by which these may be achieved are rarely considered. This occurs in spite of a large of body of general theory on which to draw. 8. Stream restoration has neglected ecosystem processes. The concept that increasing biodiversity increases ecosystem functioning is very relevant to stream restoration. Whether biodiversity affects ecosystem processes, such as decomposition, in streams is equivocal. 9. Considering the spatial scale of restoration projects is critical to success. Success is more likely with large-scale projects, but they will often be infeasible in terms of the available resources and conflicts of interest. Small-scale restoration may remedy specific problems. In general, restoration should occur at the appropriate spatial scale such that restoration is not reversed by the prevailing disturbance regime. 10. The effectiveness and predictability of stream ecosystem restoration will improve with an increased understanding of the processes by which ecosystems develop and are maintained. Ideas from general ecological theory can clearly be better incorporated into stream restoration projects. This will provide a twofold benefit in providing an opportunity both to improve restoration outcomes and to test ecological theory.},

Theories come in many forms\textemdash{}predictive statements, explanatory concepts, and mathematical and computational models (Scheiner and Willig 2011); yet all share a focus on causal explanation. In restoration, theories help to explain historical events, understand current observations, and predict future states. This last application is particularly important because ecosystems, and the task of restoring them, take place in an increasingly altered world (Steffen et al. 2015). Grounded in theory and empiricism from the ecological sciences, restoration ecology provides the science essential to the practice of ecological restoration, which in turn can be used to test those theories in real world contexts (Palmer and Ruhl 2015; Suding et al. 2015).},

Over the past decade, restoration science has gained a strong academic foothold, addressing problems faced by restoration practitioners, bringing new focus to existing ecological theory and fostering a handful of novel ecological ideas. In particular, recent advances in plant community ecology have been strongly linked with issues in ecological restoration. Evolving models of succession, assembly and state-transition are at the heart of both community ecology and ecological restoration. Recent research on seed and recruitment limitation, soil processes, and diversity\textendash{}function relationships also share strong links to restoration. Further opportunities may lie ahead in the ecology of plant ontogeny, and on the effects of contingency, such as year effects and priority effects.

  abstract = {The role of theory within ecology has changed dramatically in recent decades. Once primarily a source of qualitative conceptual framing, ecological theories and models are now often used to develop quantitative explanations of empirical patterns and to project future dynamics of specific ecological systems. In this essay, I recount my own experience of this transformation, in which accelerating computing power and the widespread incorporation of stochastic processes into ecological theory combined to create some novel integration of mathematical and statistical models. This stronger integration drives theory towards incorporating more biological realism, and I explore ways in which we can grapple with that realism to generate new general theoretical insights. This enhanced realism, in turn, may lead to frameworks for projecting ecological responses to anthropogenic change, which is, arguably, the central challenge for 21st-century ecology. In an era of big data and synthesis, ecologists are increasingly seeking to infer causality from observational data; but conventional biometry provides few tools for this project. This is a realm where theorists can and should play an important role, and I close by pointing towards some analytical and philosophical approaches developed in our sister discipline of economics that address this very problem. While I make no grand prognostications about the likely discoveries of ecological theory over the coming century, you will find in this essay a scattering of more or less far-fetched ideas that I, at least, think are interesting and (possibly) fruitful directions for our field.},

Until now, the field has focused on evaluating the relative importance of distinct processes, with niche-based environmental sorting on one side and neutral-based ecological drift and dispersal limitation on the other. This book moves beyond these artificial categorizations, showing how environmental sorting, dispersal, ecological drift, and other processes influence metacommunity structure simultaneously.Mathew Leibold and Jonathan Chase argue that the relative importance of these processes depends on the characteristics of the organisms, the strengths and types of their interactions, the degree of habitat heterogeneity, the rates of dispersal, and the scale at which the system is observed. Using this synthetic perspective, they explore metacommunity patterns in time and space, including patterns of coexistence, distribution, and diversity. Leibold and Chase demonstrate how these processes and patterns are altered by micro- and macroevolution, traits and phylogenetic relationships, and food web interactions. They then use this scale-explicit perspective to illustrate how metacommunity processes are essential for understanding macroecological and biogeographical patterns as well as ecosystem-level processes.Moving seamlessly across scales and subdisciplines, Metacommunity Ecology is an invaluable reference, one that offers a more integrated approach to ecological patterns and processes.},

We use the Tangled Nature model to discuss the co-evolutionary aspects of the connection between the microscopic level of the individual and the macroscopic systems level. At the microscopic level the individual agent may undergo evolutionary changes due to `mutations of strategies'. The micro-dynamics always run at a constant rate. Nevertheless, the systems level dynamics exhibit a completely different type of intermittent abrupt dynamics where major upheavals keep throwing the system between metastable configurations. These dramatic transitions are described by a log-Poisson time statistics. The long time effect is a collective adaptation of the ecological networks. We discuss the ecological and macro-evolutionary consequences of the adaptive dynamics and briefly describe work using the Tangled Nature framework to analyse problems in economics, sociology, innovation and sustainability.},

For illustration, we consider a generalized model of ecological meta-food webs. This fairly complex model describes the dispersal of many different species across a region consisting of a network of individual habitats while subject to realistic, nonlinear predator-prey interactions. In this example, the method reveals the intricate dependence of the dynamics on the spatial structure.

Rewilding \textemdash{} the proposed restoration of ecosystems through the (re-)introduction of species \textemdash{} is seen by many as a way to stem the loss of biodiversity and the functions and services that biodiversity provides to humanity. In addition, rewilding might lead to increased public engagement and enthusiasm for biodiversity. But what exactly is rewilding, and is it based on sound ecological understanding? Here, we show that there is a worrying lack of consensus about what rewilding is and what it isn't, which jeopardizes a clearer account of rewilding's aims, benefits and potential consequences. We also point out that scientific support for the main ecological assumptions behind rewilding, such as top-down control of ecosystems, is limited. Moreover, ecological systems are dynamic and ever-evolving, which makes it challenging to predict the consequences of introducing novel species. We also present examples of introductions or re-introductions that have failed, provoking unexpected negative consequences, and highlight that the control and extirpation of individuals of failed translocations has been shown to be extremely challenging and economically costly. Some of rewilding's loudest proponents might argue that we are advocating doing nothing instead, but we are not; we are only advocating caution and an increased understanding and awareness of what is unknown about rewilding, and what its potential outputs, especially ecological consequences, might be.},

Here, we address a fundamental and unanswered question in microbial ecology: `When do we need to understand microbial community structure to accurately predict function?' We present a statistical analysis investigating the value of environmental data and microbial community structure independently and in combination for explaining rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within 82 global datasets. Environmental variables were the strongest predictors of process rates but left 44\% of variation unexplained on average, suggesting the potential for microbial data to increase model accuracy. Although only 29\% of our datasets were significantly improved by adding information on microbial community structure, we observed improvement in models of processes mediated by narrow phylogenetic guilds via functional gene data, and conversely, improvement in models of facultative microbial processes via community diversity metrics. Our results also suggest that microbial diversity can strengthen predictions of respiration rates beyond microbial biomass parameters, as 53\% of models were improved by incorporating both sets of predictors compared to 35\% by microbial biomass alone. Our analysis represents the first comprehensive analysis of research examining links between microbial community structure and ecosystem function. Taken together, our results indicate that a greater understanding of microbial communities informed by ecological principles may enhance our ability to predict ecosystem process rates relative to assessments based on environmental variables and microbial physiology.},

  abstract = {Emergent neutrality is the idea in community ecology that species interactions may drive a system in a direction where some species become so similar that this similarity will be the primary cause for their coexistence instead of niche differentiation. A recent, widely cited model of emergent neutrality is by Scheffer and van Nes, later applied to species abundance distribution patterns by Vergnon et al. We take issue with the ecological interpretation of this model, demonstrating that it in fact presupposes important differences between superficially similar-looking species. We argue that the temptation to interpret the model as one of emergent neutrality stems from the fact that these differences are unmodeled and therefore hidden, obscuring the underlying coexistence mechanisms. We therefore claim that the model is actually one of hidden niches, and present several alternative ways to make its hidden portions more explicit. These alterations to the model also make its proper interpretation as one of hidden niches more transparent. We also polemize with the claim of Vergnon et al. that multimodality in species abundance distributions is support for their emergent neutrality model: we demonstrate that appropriate stochastic versions of classical resource partitioning or even neutral models can lead to such patterns in a robust way. Observation of these patterns is therefore inconclusive as to the underlying mechanisms that generate them.},

We explore the assembly and potential for coexistence of small communities where all species experience ontogenetic trophic niche shifts. The life-history of each species is described by a physiologically structured model and species identity is characterised by the trait: size at maturation. We show that a single species can exist in two different states: a `resource driven state' and a `cannibalistic state' with a large scope for emergent Allee effects and bistable states. Two species can coexist in two different configurations: in a `competitive coexistence' state when the ratio between sizes at maturation of the two species is less than a predator\textendash{}prey mass ratio and the resource level is low to intermediate, or in a `trophic ladder' state if the ratio of sizes at maturation is larger than the predator\textendash{}prey mass ratio at all resource levels. While there is a large scope for coexistence of two species, the scope for coexistence of three species is limited and we conclude that further trait differentiation is required for coexistence of more species-rich size-structured communities.},

These assumptions limit the plausible application of these patterns for inferring competitive interactions in nature. Here, we relax these restrictions and find that the clustering pattern is robust to contributions of unknown or unobserved niche axes. However, it may not be visible unless measured traits are close proxies for niche strategies. We conclude that patterns along single niche axes may reveal properties of interspecific competition in nature, but detecting these patterns requires natural history expertise firmly tying traits to niches.},

An integrative overview is currently lacking, due to little crosstalk between the fields and the use of different methodological approaches. Here, we review a wide range of models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks and highlight their underlying assumptions. We discuss models where feedbacks occur both within and between hierarchical levels of ecosystems, including populations, communities and abiotic environments, and consider feedbacks across spatial scales. Identifying the commonalities among feedback models, and the underlying assumptions, helps us better understand the mechanistic basis of eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be readily modelled by coupling demographic and evolutionary formalisms. We provide an overview of these approaches and suggest future integrative modelling avenues. Our overview highlights that eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been incorporated in theoretical work for nearly a century. Yet, this work does not always include the notion of rapid evolution or concurrent ecological and evolutionary time scales. We show the importance of density- and frequency-dependent selection for feedbacks, as well as the importance of dispersal as a central linking trait between ecology and evolution in a spatial context.

The theory of island biogeography, developed in the 1960s by R.H. MacArthur and E.O. Wilson, has had a tremendous impact on how ecologists understand the link between species diversity and characteristics of the habitat such as isolation and size. Recent developments have described how the inclusion of information on trophic interactions can further inform our understanding of island biogeography dynamics. Here, we extend the trophic theory of island biogeography to assess whether certain food web properties on the mainland affect colonization/extinction dynamics of species on islands. Our results highlight that both food web connectance and size on the mainland increase species diversity on islands. We also highlight that more heavily tailed degree distributions in the mainland food web correlate with less frequent but potentially more important extinction cascades on islands. The average shortest path to a basal species on islands follows a hump-shaped curve as a function of realized species richness, with food chains slightly longer than on the mainland at intermediate species richness. More modular mainland webs are also less persistent on islands. We discuss our results in the context of global changes and from the viewpoint of community assembly rules, aiming at pinpointing further theoretical developments needed to make the trophic theory of island biogeography even more useful for fundamental and applied ecology.},

  issn = {1600-0706},
  abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly aware of the interplay between evolutionary history and ecological processes in shaping current species interaction patterns. The inclusion of phylogenetic relationships in studies of species interaction networks has shown that closely related species commonly interact with sets of similar species. Notably, the degree of phylogenetic conservatism in antagonistic ecological interactions is frequently stronger among species at lower trophic levels than among those at higher trophic levels. One hypothesis that accounts for this asymmetry is that competition among consumer species promotes resource partitioning and offsets the maintenance of dietary similarity by phylogenetic inertia. Here, we used a regional plant\textendash{}herbivore network comprised of Asteraceae species and flower-head endophagous insects to evaluate how the strength of phylogenetic conservatism in species interactions differs between the two trophic levels. We also addressed whether the asymmetry in the strength of the phylogenetic signal between plants and animals depends on the overall degree of relatedness among the herbivores. We show that, beyond the previously reported compositional similarity, closely related species also share a greater proportion of counterpart phylogenetic history, both for resource and consumer species. Comparison of the patterns found in the entire network with those found in subnetworks composed of more phylogenetically restricted groups of herbivores provides evidence that resource partitioning occurs mostly at deeper phylogenetic levels, so that a positive phylogenetic signal in antagonist similarity is detectable even between closely related consumers in monophyletic subnetworks. The asymmetry in signal strength between trophic levels is most apparent in the way network modules reflect resource phylogeny, both for the entire network and for subnetworks. Taken together, these results suggest that evolutionary processes, such as phylogenetic conservatism and independent colonization history of the insect groups may be the main forces generating the phylogenetic structure observed in this particular plant\textendash{}herbivore network system.},

The interactions are determined by the characteristics of a species. The characteristics are in turn determined by the species' phylogenetic relationships, but also by factors not related to evolutionary history. Here, we test whether species' phylogenetic relationships provides a significant proxy for food web intervality. We thereafter quantify the degree to which different species traits remain valuable predictors of food web structure after the baseline effect of species' relatedness has been removed. We find that the phylogenetic relationships provide a significant background from which to estimate food web intervality and thereby structure. However, we also find that there is an important, non-negligible part of some traits, e.g., body size, in food webs that is not accounted for by the phylogenetic relationships. Additionally, both these relationships differ depending if a predator or a prey perspective is adopted. Clearly, species' evolutionary history as well as traits not determined by phylogenetic relationships shapes predator-prey interactions in food webs, and the underlying evolutionary processes take place on slightly different time scales depending on the direction of predator-prey adaptations.},

  abstract = {The ecosystem services approach has gained broad interest in regulatory and policy circles for use in ecological risk assessment. Whilst identifying several challenges, scientific experts from European regulatory authorities, the chemical industry and academia considered the approach applicable to all chemical sectors and potentially contributing to greater ecological relevance for setting and assessing environmental protection goals compared to current European regulatory frameworks for chemicals. These challenges were addressed in workshops to develop a common understanding across stakeholders on how the ecosystem services concept might be used in chemical risk assessment and what would need to be done to implement it. This paper describes the consensus outcome of those discussions. Knowledge gaps and research needs were identified and prioritised, exploring the use of novel approaches from ecology, ecotoxicology and ecological modelling. Where applicable, distinction is made between prospective and retrospective ecological risk assessment. For prospective risk assessment the development of environmental scenarios accounting for chemical exposure and ecological conditions was designated as a top priority. For retrospective risk assessment the top priority research need was development of reference conditions for key ecosystem services and guidance for their derivation. Both prospective and retrospective risk assessment would benefit from guidance on the taxa and measurement endpoints relevant to specific ecosystem services and from improved understanding of the relationships between measurement endpoints from standard toxicity tests and the ecosystem services of interest (i.e. assessment endpoints). The development of mechanistic models, which could serve as ecological production functions, was identified as a priority. A conceptual framework for future chemical risk assessment based on an ecosystem services approach is presented.},

The former measures the fraction of paths between pairs of nodes that a given node lies on, while the latter measures an average "inverse distance" between a particular node and all other nodes. Both centralities only take into account geodesic (shortest) paths between pairs of nodes. Here we demonstrate a method, based on Absorbing Random Walks, that enables us to continuously interpolate both of these centrality measures away from the geodesic limit and toward a limit where no restriction is placed on the length of the paths the walkers can explore. At this second limit, the interpolated betweenness and closeness centralities reduce, respectively, to the well-known current betweenness and information centralities.},

This hinders our understanding of the causal links between trophic interactions and the structure of animal communities. Better knowledge of trophic traits underlying predator\textendash{}prey interactions is also needed to improve models attempting to predict food web structure and dynamics from known species traits. We carried out laboratory experiments with common freshwater macroinvertebrate predators (diving beetles, dragonfly and damselfly larvae and water bugs) and their prey to assess how body size and traits related to foraging (microhabitat use, feeding mode and foraging mode) and to prey vulnerability (microhabitat use, activity and escape behaviour) affect predation strength. The underlying predator\textendash{}prey body mass allometry characterizing mean prey size and total predation pressure was modified by feeding mode of the predators (suctorial or chewing). Suctorial predators fed upon larger prey and had \texttildelow{}3 times higher mass-specific predation rate than chewing predators of the same size and may thus have stronger effect on prey abundance. Strength of individual trophic links, measured as mortality of the focal prey caused by the focal predator, was determined jointly by the predator and prey body mass and their foraging and vulnerability traits. In addition to the feeding mode, interactions between prey escape behaviour (slow or fast), prey activity (sedentary or active) and predator foraging mode (searching or ambush) strongly affected prey mortality. Searching predators was ineffective in capturing fast-escape prey in comparison with the remaining predator\textendash{}prey combinations, while ambush predators caused higher mortality than searching predators and the difference was larger in active prey. Our results imply that the inclusion of the commonly available qualitative data on foraging traits of predators and vulnerability traits of prey could substantially increase biological realism of food web descriptions.},

Classic approaches have tried to understand and predict these relationships in terms of consumptive interactions between predator and prey species, but characterizing the interaction this way is insufficient to predict the complexity and context dependency inherent in predator\textendash{}prey relationships. Recent approaches have begun to explore predator\textendash{}prey relationships in terms of an evolutionary-ecological game in which predator and prey adapt to each other through reciprocal interactions involving context-dependent expression of functional traits that influence their biomechanics. Functional traits are defined as any morphological, behavioral, or physiological trait of an organism associated with a biotic interaction. Such traits include predator and prey body size, predator and prey personality, predator hunting mode, prey mobility, prey anti-predator behavior, and prey physiological stress. Here, I discuss recent advances in this functional trait approach. Evidence shows that the nature and strength of many interactions are dependent upon the relative magnitude of predator and prey functional traits. Moreover, trait responses can be triggered by non-consumptive predator\textendash{}prey interactions elicited by responses of prey to risk of predation. These interactions in turn can have dynamic feedbacks that can change the context of the predator\textendash{}prey interaction, causing predator and prey to adapt their traits\textemdash{}through phenotypically plastic or rapid evolutionary responses\textemdash{}and the nature of their interaction.

These models provide an ideal extension of food-web models beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially probabilistic models.

Is there quantifiable regularity and predictability in citation patterns? It is clear that papers that have been cited frequently tend to accumulate more citations. It is also clear that, with time, even the most novel paper loses its currency. Some papers, however, seem to have an inherent ``fitness'' that can be interpreted as a community's response to the research. Wang et al. (p. 127; see the Perspective by Evans) developed a mechanistic model to predict citation history. The model links a paper's ultimate impact, represented by the total number of citations the paper will ever receive, to a single measurable parameter inferred from its early citation history. The model was used to identify factors that influence a journal's impact factor.
The lack of predictability of citation-based measures frequently used to gauge impact, from impact factors to short-term citations, raises a fundamental question: Is there long-term predictability in citation patterns? Here, we derive a mechanistic model for the citation dynamics of individual papers, allowing us to collapse the citation histories of papers from different journals and disciplines into a single curve, indicating that all papers tend to follow the same universal temporal pattern. The observed patterns not only help us uncover basic mechanisms that govern scientific impact but also offer reliable measures of influence that may have potential policy implications.
Early citation history can be used to model the total number of citations a paper will receive and to compare journals. [Also see Perspective by Evans]

  abstract = {When making predictions about ecosystems, we often have available a number of different ecosystem models that attempt to represent their dynamics in a detailed mechanistic way. Each of these can be used as a simulator of large-scale experiments and make projections about the fate of ecosystems under different scenarios to support the development of appropriate management strategies. However, structural differences, systematic discrepancies and uncertainties lead to different models giving different predictions. This is further complicated by the fact that the models may not be run with the same functional groups, spatial structure or time scale. Rather than simply trying to select a ``best'' model, or taking some weighted average, it is important to exploit the strengths of each of the models, while learning from the differences between them. To achieve this, we construct a flexible statistical model of the relationships between a collection of mechanistic models and their biases, allowing for structural and parameter uncertainty and for different ways of representing reality. Using this statistical meta-model, we can combine prior beliefs, model estimates and direct observations using Bayesian methods and make coherent predictions of future outcomes under different scenarios with robust measures of uncertainty. In this study, we take a diverse ensemble of existing North Sea ecosystem models and demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to answer the question what would have happened to demersal fish if fishing was to stop.},

In this article we draw upon the methods of quantum field theory and the foundation of neutral community ecology to derive the first spatially explicit neutral prediction for the SAR. We find that the SAR has three phases, with a power law increase at intermediate scales, consistent with decades of documented empirical patterns. Our model also provides a building block for incorporating non-neutral biological variation, with the potential to bridge the gap between neutral and niche-based approaches to community assembly.

In matrix analysis, the effective competition matrix represents the Schur complement of the species interaction matrix. It has been previously shown that the main eigenvalue of this effective competition matrix strongly influences the structural stability of the model ecosystem. Here, we show that the spectral properties of the effective competition matrix also strongly influence the dynamical stability of the model ecosystem. In particular, a necessary condition for diagonal stability of the full system, which guarantees global stability, is that the effective competition matrix is diagonally stable, which means that intergroup interactions must be weaker than intra-group competition in appropriate units. For mutualistic or competitive interactions, diagonal stability of the effective competition is a sufficient condition for global stability if the inter-group interactions are suitably correlated, in the sense that the biomass that each species provides to (removes from) the other group must be proportional to the biomass that it receives from (is removed by) it. For a non-LV mutualistic system with saturating interactions, we show that the diagonal stability of the corresponding LV system close to the fixed point is a sufficient condition for global stability.},

  volume = {450},
  issn = {0022-5193},
  abstract = {The feasibility domain of an ecological community can be described by the set of environmental abiotic and biotic conditions under which all co-occurring and interacting species in a given site and time can have positive abundances. Mathematically, the feasibility domain corresponds to the parameter space compatible with positive (feasible) solutions at equilibrium for all the state variables in a system under a given model of population dynamics. Under specific dynamics, the existence of a feasible equilibrium is a necessary condition for species persistence regardless of whether the feasible equilibrium is dynamically stable or not. Thus, the size of the feasibility domain can also be used as an indicator of the tolerance of a community to random environmental variations. This has motivated a rich research agenda to estimate the feasibility domain of ecological communities. However, these methodologies typically assume that species interactions are static, or that input and output energy flows on each trophic level are unconstrained. Yet, this is different to how communities behave in nature. Here, we present a step-by-step quantitative guideline providing illustrative examples, computational code, and mathematical proofs to study systematically the feasibility domain of ecological communities under changes of interspecific interactions and subject to different constraints on the trophic energy flows. This guideline covers multi-trophic communities that can be formed by any type of interspecific interactions. Importantly, we show that the relative size of the feasibility domain can significantly change as a function of the biological information taken into consideration. We believe that the availability of these methods can allow us to increase our understanding about the limits at which ecological communities may no longer tolerate further environmental perturbations, and can facilitate a stronger integration of theoretical and empirical research.},

The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Collapse, stability, and dynamical shifts between these states are hallmarks of ecological systems. A major goal in ecosystem research is to identify how limits of these states change with diversity, complexity, interaction-topology, and hierarchies. The primary focus has been on identifying conditions for a system to shift from strict stability to complete collapse. While this boundary is indeed of central importance, it is possible that real ecosystems can show a larger variety of responses to environmental changes. Here, rather than focusing solely on limits of stability or collapse, we quantify and map the full phase space and the boundaries between regions with different response characteristics. We explore this phase space as biodiversity and complexity are varied for interaction webs in which consumer-resource interactions are chosen randomly and driven by Generalized-Lotka-Volterra dynamics. The ability to pinpoint the location of a system within this phase space and quantify the system9s proximity to collapse is made possible via a novel mathematical analysis that we develop. Previous work that focused only on collapse lacks the context within the overall phase space to be able to predict when systems are nearing or are poised to collapse. Moreover, in contrast to previous collapse predictions, we account for the fact that dynamics often lead to single species extinctions. Allowing and accounting for these single-species extinctions reveals more detailed structure of the complexity-stability phase space and introduces an intermediate phase between stability and collapse, Extinction Continuum, that give a more nuanced view of how an ecosystem can respond to internal and external changes. With this extended phase space and our construction of predictive measures based strictly on observable quantities, real systems can be better mapped, than using canonical measures by May or critical slowdown, for proximity to collapse and path through phase-space to collapse.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In particular, while kin selection is widely believed to have a pervasive influence on animal behaviour, reciprocity is generally thought to be rare. Despite this general agreement, there has been no direct test comparing the relative roles of kinship and reciprocity in explaining animal altruism. In this paper, we report on the results of such a test based on a meta-analysis of allogrooming in primates, grooming being probably the most common altruistic behaviour among mammals. In direct contrast to the prevailing view, reciprocity played a much larger role than kinship in explaining primate allogrooming.

  abstract = {High relatedness among interacting individuals has generally been considered a precondition for the evolution of altruism. However, kin-selection theory also predicts the evolution of altruism when relatedness is low, as long as the cost of the altruistic act is minor compared with its benefit. Here, we demonstrate evidence for a low-cost altruistic act in bacteria. We investigated Escherichia coli responding to the attack of an obligately lytic phage by committing suicide in order to prevent parasite transmission to nearby relatives. We found that bacterial suicide provides large benefits to survivors at marginal costs to committers. The cost of suicide was low, because infected cells are moribund, rapidly dying upon phage infection, such that no more opportunity for reproduction remains. As a consequence of its marginal cost, host suicide was selectively favoured even when relatedness between committers and survivors approached zero. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that low-cost suicide can evolve with ease, represents an effective host-defence strategy, and seems to be widespread among microbes. Moreover, low-cost suicide might also occur in higher organisms as exemplified by infected social insect workers leaving the colony to die in isolation.},

  abstract = {The energetic relation between different trophic levels and populations in a community involves primarily potential energy transfer in complex feed-back systems, making the applicability of existing steady state thermodynamic theory questionable, since the requirements for direct evaluation of entropy are not met by ecological systems. The only form of energy considered here was potential energy. The efficiency of a population does not have a unique meaning. Three different concepts of efficiency were defined and evaluated for Daphnia pulex. Two of these, the ecological efficiency and population efficiency, refer to the population level. The growth efficiency refers to individual organisms. Ecological efficiency is a function of the rate of removal of yield and of the kind of yield animals removed. Population efficiency is a function of the kind of animals removed as yield and the interaction between these animals and the population. Growth efficiency does not depend on the removal of yield at all. It is a function of individual food consumption, growth rate and the energetic cost of reproduction. These three are interrelated. In general, for a particular system of predation ecological efficiency is proportional to population efficiency. Population efficiency is related to the individual growth efficiency through the effect of the removal of animals on the maintenance cost per calorie of standing crop, which in turn is a function of growth efficiency. The maximum ecological efficiencies found in the Daphnia experiments are of the same order as ecological efficiencies found in nature, implying that ecological efficiency is effectively constant. Presumably the observed value of c. ten per cent has selective significance. In speculating on the future development of community ecology, I suggested that certain generalizations now available, including the approximate constancy of ecological efficiency, restrict the development of possible theories. When a sufficient number of these generalizations have been stated and tested a comprehensive predictive general theory of community ecology will appear, if only by the elimination of all conceivable theories whose predictions do not conform to the generalizations.},

The model is intended to represent a warm-blooded vertebrate predator and its prey. The main conclusions are: (1) Coexistence of predator and prey is possible, but if so, the number of prey present will not be substantially below the equilibrium number in the absence of predators.

In the first part of the review, general results from models of single species or of interacting species are summarized. In a number of cases, there are useful maximization and equilibration principles that can be applied to particular coevolutionary problems. Such principles can sometimes be used without making explicit genetic assumptions. The second part of the review summarizes various models of particular types of ecological interactions: generalized competition, character displacement, predator-prey and host-parasite interactions, and mutualism. When possible, the principles available from the general theory are applied. There is also some discussion of the role of different time scales of genetic and ecological change and of the role of assumptions concerning genetic variability in each species. The current emphasis in theoretical studies is on the equilibrium properties of panmictic species under constant conditions. Even under those restrictive conditions, a wide variety of results can be obtained, but it does not seem that there is a consistent effect of coevolution on community stability.},

The results are a beginning toward answering some of the theoretical questions presented to population ecologists. The present data indicate that if an adequate environment is encompassed, the predator-prey relation is not necessarily self-annihilative, and that absolutely restrictive refuges are not essential. The results also support the view that more stable control of a population is likely to result in an environment of balanced heterogeneity than in one of simpler structure. In this study a predator-prey relation was maintained for three successive oscillation waves before overexploitation finally ended the relation in the most complex universe or ecosystem utilized. Some of the questions which may ultimately be answered by such studies include: Are such oscillations inherently of increasing amplitude? If so, are there commonly present forces which act to cancel this tendency? Does the presence of other significant species in addition to the two original coactors tend to stabilize or disturb the relation? What may be the effect of changes in the physical conditions upon the degree of stability or permanence of the relation? Can evidence be obtained regarding the concept that the prey, as well as the predator, may benefit from the relation? What is the order of influence on stability of such factors as shelter, food, disease, and natural enemies of other kinds?},

It is important for managers and policy-makers to make decisions on this issue that are based on the best available scientific evidence. Therefore, it is first important to understand if there is indeed an impact of vertebrate predators on prey, and then to quantify this impact.Methodology/Principal FindingsUsing the UK as a case study, we use a meta-analytical approach to review the available evidence to assess the effect of vertebrate predation on animal prey abundance. We find a significant effect of predators on prey abundance across our studies. On average, there is a 1.6 fold increase in prey abundance in the absence of predation. However, we show significant heterogeneity in effect sizes, and discuss how the method of predator control, whether the predator is native or non-native, and aspects of study design, may be potential causes.Conclusions/SignificanceOur results allow some cautious policy recommendations to be made regarding the management of predator and prey populations. Meta-analysis is an important tool for understanding general patterns in the effect of predators on prey abundance across studies. Such an approach is especially valuable where management decisions need to be made in the absence of site-specific information.},

One 30-cell parasite-host system survived for longer than a year. Increasing the number of cells from 16 to 30 in the population cage, decreased the average density of parasites and hosts per cell, but increased the chances of survival of the system. The amplitude of the fluctuations of the parasite-host populations did not increase with time as proposed by Nicholson's theoretical models but was limited by intraspecific competition. The rapid rate of evolution which occurred was the most important aspect of the experimental parasite-host populations. Within eight generations in a 16-cell system, reproductive capacity of the parasite declined 40 per cent. In 20 generations in a 30-cell system, reproductive capacity of the parasite declined 68 per cent. Such important qualitative changes in the parasite and host populations influenced the population characteristics of the systems to some degree. This demonstrates the importance of considering qualitative changes in studies of population dynamics of all herbivore-plant, predator-prey, and parasite-host systems.},

  abstract = {Modelers often need to quantify the rates at which zooplankton consume a variety of species, size classes and trophic types. Implicit in the equations used to describe the multiple resource functional response (i.e. how nutritional intake varies with resource densities) are assumptions that are not often stated, let alone tested. This is problematic because models are sensitive to the details of these formulations. Here, we enable modelers to make more informed decisions by providing them with a new framework for considering zooplankton feeding on multiple resources. We define a new classification of multiple resource responses that is based on preference, selection and switching, and we develop a set of mathematical diagnostics that elucidate model assumptions. We use these tools to evaluate the assumptions and biological dynamics inherent in published multiple resource responses. These models are shown to simulate different resource preferences, implied single resource responses, changes in intake with changing resource densities, nutritional benefits of generalism, and nutritional costs of selection. Certain formulations are further shown to exhibit anomalous dynamics such as negative switching and sub-optimal feeding. Such varied responses can have vastly different ecological consequences for both zooplankton and their resources; inappropriate choices may incorrectly quantify biologically-mediated fluxes and predict spurious dynamics. We discuss how our classes and diagnostics can help constrain parameters, interpret behaviors, and identify limitations to a formulation's applicability for both regional (e.g. High-Nitrate-Low-Chlorophyll regions comprising large areas of the Pacific) and large-scale applications (e.g. global biogeochemical or climate change models). Strategies for assessing uncertainty and for using the mathematics to guide future experimental investigations are also discussed.},

  abstract = {1. We report the role of dispersal in the metapopulation dynamics of a protist predator--prey pair, the predaceous ciliate Didinium nasutum Muller feeding on the bacterivorous ciliate Colpidium cf. striatum Stokes. In previous work we showed that this extinction-prone pair persisted as metapopulations in subdivided habitats. 2. An experiment assessed the effects of habitat subdivision on persistence and dynamics. Undivided habitats were 270 or 750 mL in volume, and subdivided habitats (arrays) were sets of nine or 25 linked 30 mL bottles (270 or 750 mL total volume), each replicated three times. Undivided microcosms allowed maximum dispersal, whereas subdivision reduced dispersal. Within arrays, bottles with more connecting tubes allowed more dispersal. Nine and 25 bottle arrays also differed in the mean number of connections per bottle. The effects of dispersal on predator--prey dynamics were tested by comparing subdivided vs. undivided microcosms, bottles with different numbers of connecting tubes, and nine vs. 25 bottle arrays. 3. We tested the following predictions from metapopulation theory. (i) Predator and prey persistence and predator abundance will be greatest at intermediate dispersal rates. (ii) Prey abundance, local population variability and asynchrony in population fluctuations will be greatest at low dispersal rates. (iii) Predator:prey ratios will be greatest at high dispersal rates. 4. Predictions were confirmed, except for the following. (i) Two measures of synchrony differed in whether they showed the expected pattern. Spatial synchrony (estimated via correlation of densities among patches within sampling dates) showed high variance and did not vary with dispersal rates. However, spatial variability (CV of density across adjacent pairs of linked bottles), showed the predicted decrease with increased dispersal. (ii) Evidence that dispersal increases predator:prey ratios was inconclusive. Predator:prey ratios were lower in undivided 750 mL microcosms than in 750 mL arrays, possibly because predators over-exploited prey in undivided microcosms, so that both became scarce. Conversely, within arrays, predator:prey ratios were greatest in bottles that allowed the most dispersal, as predicted. 5. This work generally confirms the predicted effects of dispersal on predator--prey metapopulation dynamics. It also demonstrates the need for models to include more realism, e.g. the possibility of over-exploitation with very high dispersal.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity changes have proven surprisingly complex to estimate and understand. While there are negative trends at a global scale such as the substantial losses of vertebrate species (1), changes at local scales may show large variation, with no clear overall trend (2, 3). Because assessing and improving the status of biodiversity are at the core of international agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the associated Aichi Biodiversity Targets for 2020 (4), we need to know when trends in biodiversity may differ and the causes of such differences. In PNAS, Magurran et al. (5) report that different components of biodiversity do not have the same trends over time in tropical freshwater ecosystems, and that these trends differ among taxonomic groups (fishes, invertebrates, and diatoms).Magurran et al. (5) quantify biodiversity changes at 16 river sites in Trinidad over 19 time points covering the dry and wet seasons of 5 y. They collected over 670,000 individuals, which were identified at different resolutions in fishes (species), invertebrates (family), and diatoms (morphospecies) because taxonomy is still poorly known for many groups in the tropics. They focus on two aspects of biodiversity changes: temporal {$\alpha$} diversity, measured using the number of species and functions of their relative abundance, and temporal {$\beta$} diversity, which represents change in assemblage composition over time and is measured as turnover in species identities and relative abundance (Fig. 1). Different diversity measures emphasize different characteristics of assemblages (6). Magurran et al. (5) use 11 metrics, ranging from the number of observed or estimated species at a site and metrics emphasizing evenness or dominance to a range of (dis)similarity measures to evaluate compositional differences between assemblages. These are based on either presence/absence or abundance data and emphasize turnover in species identities (species replacement) and nestedness [associated with richness \ldots{} {$\carriagereturn$}1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Despite its potential to serve as a null model for community dynamics, there is currently no accepted methodology for measuring deviations from the theory and testing it. Here we propose a novel and easily applicable methodology for quantifying deviations from the predictions and assumptions of DE by comparing observed community time-series to a randomization-based null model. We show that this methodology has good statistical properties on simulated data, and it can detect deviations from both the assumptions and predictions of DE in the classical Florida Keys experiment. We discuss alternative methods and present guidelines for practical use of the methodology, hoping it will enhance the applicability of DE as a reference for studying changes in ecological communities.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Models cannot replace experiments nor can they prove that particular mechanisms are at work in a given situation.
